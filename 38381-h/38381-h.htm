<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The purpose of this book is twofold&mdash;first and foremost,
to illustrate a question of principle by the aid
of historic test and application; secondly, to furnish
for the use of historical students an elementary
handbook of the currencies of the more important
European states from the thirteenth century downwards.</p>

<p>Little need be said as to this latter purpose.
The total omission of the historic, reasoned, and
consecutive study of currency history&mdash;the most
important domain of practical economics&mdash;from the
curriculum of every university in the land is matter
for surprise and regret, and can only be attributed to
the lack of an initiative and of a handbook.</p>

<p>As to the former purpose, there is no field of
history so strewn with scientific (<i>i.e.</i> comparative and
prophetic) possibilities as economic history; and in
economic history there is no department in which the
study of the experience of other times and nations is
more necessary and resultful, lesson-full, wisdom-full,
than the domain of currency. The verdict of history<!-- Page viii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
on the great problem of the nineteenth century&mdash;bimetallism&mdash;is
clear and crushing and final, and
against the evidence of history no gainsaying of
theory ought for a moment to stand.</p>

<p>Throughout mediæval Europe and up to the close
of the eighteenth century the currency of Europe was
practically bimetallic&mdash;practically, because actually so
without the prescription of a law of tender, and
without the allowance of any theoretic grasp or
conception of the practice as distinctively what
nowadays we understand as bimetallic.</p>

<p>The conception of a law of tender is quite
modern. And the evolution of the idea of such a
law has gone hand in hand with the evolution of a
conception of monetary theory on the part of the
legislator&mdash;that is, with the bitter experience which
for want of such a conception Europe endured for
centuries. In all systems of jurisprudence money
and minting appertains to the kingly office, and the
development of the law of tender is to be traced
in royal proclamations of the King in Council for
long before it became the subject of parliamentary
legislation. For centuries, such proclamations were
issued, referring to a prohibition of export of the
precious metals, banishing foreign coins from the
land, or, again, permitting their circulation, and, in
that case, prescribing the rough tariff or rate
according to which (foreign) coin for (native) coin
they should be current. In such proclamations there
is no idea of separating the two metals, gold and<!-- Page ix --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
silver; there is no idea of a law of tender; there is
no intention to declare a ratio; there is no conception
of <i>bullion</i> apart from coin. The two metals had
grown to be the circulating and exchange medium;
they were actually there, and all that had to be done
was to keep them there. The advantage which was
to be derived from a trade in bullion, and from an
understanding of the effects of differently-prevailing
ratios in different countries, was known only to the
Jew and the Italian. They plied their trade in secret,
and the legislator was only apprised of the result by
suddenly finding a slipping away and dearth of
coinage. Then the legislator altered the tariff, and
gradually rose to the conception of the ratio as
underlying this process of seduction. Then, as a
further defence of a particular class of coins, he
imposed a limitation on the tender of such, so as to
prevent bullion operations on it. This limitation was
the first development of a law of tender. Throughout,
from the thirteenth to the eighteenth century, both
gold and silver had been actually employed in
European commerce without any idea either of
declaring or of restricting the tender, whether of the
one or the other.</p>

<p>The final outcome of the application of the law of
tender was the development of the modern monometallic
system&mdash;a system in which alone lay the
safeguard against the operation of the bullionist. It
was only at the close of the eighteenth century that
England evolved this system and flung away the<!-- Page x --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
last remains of that mediæval ignorance which had
brought with it such a dower of mishap. France has
taken almost a century of further experience before
arriving at the same point of development.</p>

<p>Another point. At the time that England was
shaking off the mediæval system France, too, was
accomplishing a reform of her money system. It
stopped half-way. The old kingly prerogative of
altering the coinage was taken away, the unit of the
currency was declared definite and unchangeable, and
the seigniorage on minting was abolished. So much
was accomplished by her law of 1803. But no
further application was made of the law of tender
than to throw the sanction of legal enactment over
that mediæval system which had been the bane of
France since first two metals found circulation in
her bounds. As far as tender is concerned, there is
no difference between the practice of the French
monetary system in 1726 and that of 1803. The
system was bimetallic in both cases&mdash;in the first case,
legally by recognition and as resting on the royal
jurisdiction; in the second case, legally by direct
legislative or parliamentary enactment. The idea that
the law of 1803 created a new system and a new
heaven for France is doubly absurd. It was a
continuation of a very old and a very danger-fraught
system, with its roots deep in mediæval ignorance
and practice.</p>

<p>In addition to this&mdash;and quite as demonstrably&mdash;there
was no conception of a theory of bimetallism in<!-- Page xi --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
1803, nor any conception of a bimetallic function to
be performed for the good of the human race by
bimetallic France. This is a conception of the
schools, and bred of later needs and hopes and fears.
The modern theory of bimetallism is almost the only
instance in history of a theory growing not out of
practice, but of the failure of practice; resting not on
data verified, but on data falsified and censure-marked.
No words can be too strong of condemnation
for the theorising of the bimetallist who, by
sheer imaginings, tries to justify theoretically what
has failed in five centuries of history, and to expound
theoretically what has proved itself incapable of
solution save by cutting and casting away.</p>

<p>Such a verdict as this of history, negative as it is,
must strike many a serious mind with dismay. The
following of bimetallism would not be what it is were
it not for the despair of any other remedy for the
situation at the moment. We are thereby left
apparently hopeless and remediless. But the first
step to the discovery of a true and possible remedy,
if any exists, can only be the casting away of the
false and impossible.</p>

<p>The difference between the monetary problem of
the seventeenth century and that of to-day lies in
this, that while there has been continuity of history
and development there has been a change of needs
and circumstance. The danger of arbitrage transactions
to the mediæval legislator lay in the fact that
they stripped the country, which suffered from them,<!-- Page xii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
not, or not merely, of a bullion reserve, but of her
actual currency, and rendered even internal trade
impossible. He accordingly tried to arrest the drain
by threatening imprisonment and death.</p>

<p>To-day the safety and supply of the internal
currency of the various states is provided for by a
monometallic system or by note issue, while, conversely,
trade in the precious metals has become free,
and bullion flows automatically from land to land in
accordance with the dictates of a now rightly-conceived
theory of international trade. Just so far
the monetary problem has changed&mdash;becoming a
question of the evolution of a stable international
exchange system. The theoretic pretensions of
bimetallism have correspondingly widened, but on any
ground, wide or narrow, the only material for the
study, comprehension, and judgment of such pretensions
lies in the actual experience of Europe during
the past five centuries.</p>

<p>A few words of more particular explanation are
necessary.</p>

<p>1. To the student of money and monetary
standards the perpetually recurring phenomena of
reductions of the unit and standard weights and
contents of coins will present no difficulty. Three
causes underlay the process&mdash;(1) the practice of
alloying, (2) the competitive and dishonest action of
governments, (3) the ideal nature of the unit itself,
which permitted, literally, anything in the way of
arbitrary manipulation (compare, <i>e.g.</i>, the very<!-- Page xiii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
different depreciations of the English shilling and
the French sou, being both descendants of the
solidus; or again, of the French livre and the Italian
lire, being both descendants of the libra).</p>

<p>2. A second and much greater difficulty is
presented by the confusion of nomenclature. It is
often difficult to determine what particular piece is
meant by a given name, or, if the identity of the
piece can be fixed, its period may still be uncertain.
In French numismatic history, for instance, the term
florin d'or or denier d'or is used in documents quite
generically for the more specific florins d'or à l'agnel,
à l'écu, aux fleurs de lis, à la masse, moutons d'or,
etc. This quite indeterminate use of the word
"florin" (= denier = "piece," or generally, "coin")
may possibly explain the crux to be found on pages
<a href="#Page_3">3</a>, <a href="#Page_9">9</a>, <a href="#Page_301">301</a>, and <a href="#Page_399">399</a> of the text (<i>infra</i>), where florins
d'or are mentioned in French history more than
seventy years before the first authentic minting of the
gold florin at Florence.</p>

<p>3. With regard to the figures of the ratios there
is great difference and divergence among the various
authorities. The declared ratio may be of a double
nature&mdash;(1) mercantile, as calculated on the purchase
price of gold and silver in the open market; (2) legal,
as settled by law in the terms prescribed for Mint
purchase and issue. The former is comparatively
simple, but it is not until a quite recent date, the
opening of the eighteenth century, that it is statistically
determinable. The table of the commercial<!-- Page xiv --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
ratio (pp. <a href="#Page_157">157</a>-<a href="#Page_159">9</a> <i>infra</i>) is taken from Soetbeer, and
was by him calculated on the Hamburg exchange and
London market rates. The competing figures of the
commercial ratio drawn up by Ingham in his Report
to the Senate of the United States (4th May 1830),
and by John White, of the same date (see <i>United
States Report of the International Monetary Conference
of 1878</i>, pp. 583, 647), I regard as
comparatively untrustworthy.</p>

<p>With regard to the legal or Mint ratio (see <i>infra</i>,
tables, pp. <a href="#Page_40">40</a>, <a href="#Page_69">69</a>-<a href="#Page_70">70</a>, <a href="#Page_157">157</a>) there is the greatest
discrepancy, and I print the figures with much
trepidation and every mental reserve. The differences
in the results arrived at by the various authorities
are due to the difference in method of calculation,
according as the issue price or the purchase price at
the Mint is taken (<i>i.e.</i> with or without allowance of
seigniorage and remedy), or according as the pure or
gross content of the piece is calculated from (<i>i.e.</i> with
or without allowance for alloy). As a matter of fact,
hardly any two authorities or sets of calculations
agree. See, for instance, duplicate sets of figures
for Holland in <a href="#Page_301">Appendix 1</a>. to Schimmel's <i>Geschiedkundig
overzicht</i>; or again, compare Soetbeer's figures
with those deduced by Köhler in his <i>Grundliche
Nachricht</i>; or by Dr. Arnold Luschin, in the
<i>Proceedings of the Congrés International de Numismatique</i>,
1880, p. 443; or with those deducible from
Le Blanc's tables (<i>infra</i>, <a href="#Page_396">Appendix VI.</a>). It is to
this difference that must be attributed the discrepancy<!-- Page xv --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
in the statement of the ratio by the French Mint
authorities in 1640 (see text, <i>infra</i>, p. <a href="#Page_92">92</a> and <a href="#Footnote_11_14">note</a>,
<i>ibid.</i>). The difficulty of calculating the European
Mint ratio at any moment can be judged from the
experience and statements of persons so widely
apart as Sir Isaac Newton in England, Mirabeau
and Calonne in France, and Morris and Hamilton
in the United States (see <i>infra</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_172">172</a>-<a href="#Page_173">3</a>, <a href="#Page_229">229</a>-<a href="#Page_230">30</a>,
and <a href="#Page_157">251</a>).</p>

<p>With regard to the scope of the present work, it
is confined entirely to the history of metallic currency
and standard. There is no reference to the paper-money
experience of any country, not even America
or Austria. Such a subject must form matter for a
separate treatment. The account of Austrian money
is, therefore, to be found in <a href="#Page_360">Appendix v.</a>, under
Germany, and on the effects of the latest Austrian
reform (as also of the latest development in India and
the United States) no opinion whatever is expressed.
I content myself with the simple statement of fact
and event.</p>

<p>In appending a list of the authorities used, it is
difficult to overcome the feeling of humiliation which
has come to me from the contrast of the ephemeral,
slight, and unworthy treatment of monetary history
to-day, with the grand, solid, scholarly works which
the eighteenth century produced. With the exception
of Soetbeer's magnificent labours, without which the
present work would have been simply impossible as
far as the statements of production and relativity of<!-- Page xvi --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
the precious metals are concerned, and of the similar
historic work of M. Ottomar Haupt, the literature of
this subject to-day is light and polemic and transitory
to a nauseating degree.</p>

<h4>From the Commencement of Gold Coinages to
the Discovery of America, 1252-1492</h4>


<p>The monetary history of Europe begins in the
thirteenth century, and in the Italian peninsula. Its
starting-point is the era of the reintroduction of gold
into the coinages of the Western nations, and is
definitely marked for us by the minting of the gold
florin of Florence in 1252. For all practical purposes
gold had gone out of use since the seventh century,
and after the submersion of the Roman Empire; and
the currencies of the nations of mediæval Europe
rested on a silver basis entirely. There are limitations
to the truth of this statement, but they are of
such a nature as not materially to affect it. In Spain,
for instance, the Moors kept up a tradition of gold
coinage similar to that of Rome, from the eighth to
the middle of the thirteenth century. But its influence
on the monetary system of Christian Spain is<!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
not even a matter of question. At the other extremity
of the Mediterranean, at Byzantium, seat of the
Eastern Empire, the best traditions of the coinage
system of Rome were preserved for centuries after
the imperial city had fallen before the invasions of
the northern barbarians. Indeed, the monetary
system of the Eastern empire, by becoming, as it did,
the model which Charlemagne copied in his currency
enactments, became the basis of all the modern
European systems. Further than this, the presence
of gold <i>Byzants</i> can be traced here and there, at
isolated points and dates, all over the darkness of
those early centuries of the Middle Ages, when all
coining art seemed forgotten among the races of
Central Europe.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding such limitations, however, it still
remains true that the monetary history of the modern
world dates from the thirteenth and not the seventh
century, and from the little commercial states of Italy
rather than from Byzantium. Previous to the minting
of the gold florin of Florence there is no trace of any
independent minting of gold coins on a commercial
scale by any state of mediæval central Europe. The
currency system of England, for instance, from the
time of the Saxons to the days of Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> was
based entirely on silver. In endless variety and under
a diversity of names the silver penny was the unit coin
current of the realm. Its equivalent in the Frankish
Empire was the silver denarius, which Charlemagne
had made the unit of his system, and which so con<!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>tinued
for both the kingdom of France and the Holy
Roman Empire till the fourteenth century. Finally,
among the numerous states of Italy, with each their
little independent Mint, there is no trace of the coinage
of gold until the days of the commercial greatness of
Florence and Venice. For eight centuries or more
those races of Europe, which were to turn the course of
the modern world and build its civilisation anew, were
ignorant of the commercial use of what has been through
all history the most potent factor in civilisation&mdash;gold.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE GOLD FLORIN OF FLORENCE</i></div>

<p>The explanation of the reintroduction and recoinage
of gold is to be found in the history of the
Crusades and of the commercial growth of the petty
independent states which sprang from the political
confusion of Italy. No sooner had they achieved
each their little autonomous existence than they
threw themselves with feverish energy into the
development of the trade with the East. Florence
and Venice, Pisa and Genoa, led the way and reaped
the fruits; and it was in her most flourishing time,
when she had conquered her rivals, Pisa and Siena,
and was enjoying a prosperous peace and active trade,
that Florence, at the instance of the chief of her merchants,
resolved on the coining of the gold florin (1252).<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The mere idea of such a gold coinage could only<!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
be derived from the East&mdash;from Byzantium. But it
is a curious fact that the importation of it should be
due in the first place to the Crusades. Frederick <span class="smcap">II.</span>
of Sicily was elected Emperor of the Holy Roman
Empire in 1212. Sixteen years later he headed the
Fifth Crusade, and the gold coin (<i>Augustale</i>) which
he issued some time between his return from that
crusade and his death, probably commemorates his
wish to rival the appearance of opulence of the
Eastern court. This Sicilian coin is the direct
ancestor of the florin of Florence, and to it would fitly
belong the honour of leading in a new era, were it
not that the superior beauty of the Florentine coin
gave it universal currency and reputation, and extinguished
the memory of its predecessor.</p>

<p>The gold coin of Genoa (<i>Genoviva</i>) is supposed
to have issued in the same year as the florin (1252).
Five years later (1257) Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> of England
imitated the florin in his gold <i>pennies</i>, and more than
thirty years (31st October 1284) later Venice followed
the lead of Florence and instituted a coinage of gold
<i>zecchinos</i>, under the dogeship of Giovanni Dandolo.</p>

<p>Two conditions were essential to the bringing
about so momentous a revolution as this, however
little the mind of contemporaries may have known it
as such. In the first place, the foreign trade of the
Italian republics must have become so extensive as
to demand a currency medium of higher denomination
than silver; and, secondly, that trade must have
developed in such directions as to tap gold-using or<!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
gold-bearing regions in order <span class="correction" title="corrected from 'to the supply'">to supply</span> the
Italian mints. It is a curious fact that both these
conditions were realised through the instrumentality
of the Crusades. The quickening effect of these vast
movements on the trade of the Mediterranean is well
known, but their influence in the second direction has
not hitherto been pointed out. In the Fourth Crusade
Venice lent the force which captured Byzantium
(1203), and when, by her arms, Baldwin, Count of
Flanders, had been seated on the Eastern throne,
Venice reaped her reward in three-eighths of the
territories of the Eastern Empire. She received
Peloponnesus and a chain of islands in the Ægean, and
by the hold she had on Constantinople secured the
virtual control of the Black Sea. In its turn the
control of the Black Sea brought with it the monopoly
of the overland trade with India.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE TRADE OF VENICE</i></div>

<p>At one and the same moment, therefore, Venice
acquired possession of a huge treasure of gold
wrested from the conquered city, and of the then only
gold-yielding districts&mdash;the Crimea&mdash;and of an intercolonial
trade, demanding a more enhanced currency
medium. The result of such a combination of circumstances
was irresistible. During the continuance of
the "Latin Empire" at Byzantium, Venice and her
sister state were practically the only merchants of
Europe.</p>

<p>The institution of a gold coinage among the
Italian republics, therefore, marks for us an era of
commercial expansion which is only fitly to be<!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
compared with that of Holland in the seventeenth
century, or of our own country in modern times.</p>

<p>We are not concerned with tracing the effects of
this extraordinary movement further than as they
bore in their train the dower of a currency of gold.</p>

<p>In the European system, Venice was the intermediary
between the spice-laden east and the wool-bearing
north. England, the wool-growing country
of fourteenth-century Europe; Flanders, the home
of the weaving industry; the Hanse Towns of Germany
and the gradually forming kingdom of France
were successively brought face to face with the new
medium of currency; and if the story of the gradual
adoption of that new medium could be written, it
would form one of the most instructive of all chapters
of currency and commercial history.</p>

<p>As it is, we have only uncertain and scattered data.</p>

<p>In the case of Germany&mdash;of chief importance in
the process by reason of her geographical position
midway between the Mediterranean and the north&mdash;the
first minting of gold in imitation of the Italian
states fell in the second quarter of the fourteenth
century. Of the two types of gold monies issued by
the Emperor Louis <span class="smcap">IV.</span>, surnamed "Bavarian," the
first, struck some short time before 1328, was in
direct imitation of the florin of Florence. The second,
struck some little time later, was a copy of the <i>écu d'or</i>
of Philip <span class="smcap">VI.</span> of France.</p>

<p>In 1337 our own King Edward was made vicar-general
and lieutenant to the Emperor, with powers<!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
to coin monies of gold and silver. He accordingly
kept his winter at the Castle of Louvain, and caused
great sums of money both of gold and silver to be
coined at Antwerp. Two years later, this same
Emperor Louis, the Bavarian, granted to the Duke
Rainhold of Gueldres the right to mint gold coins,
"after the valuation of the gold monies of the Archbishop
of <span class="correction" title="comma added">Cologne,</span> the Duke of Brabant, and the
Counts of Hainault and Holland." In the following
year he granted to the free state of Lübeck a similar
right&mdash;the patent expressly stipulating that their gold
coins should not exceed in weight or value the gold
florin of Florence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BEGINNINGS OF A GOLD COINAGE IN GERMANY</i></div>

<p>Sixteen years later (1356) the general liberty of
coining gold was conceded to the seven Electoral
Princes by the Golden Bull of the Emperor Charles
<span class="smcap">IV.</span>, and subsequently state after state and free town
after free town purchased or were granted the right.
Even as late as 1372, in the patent granting to
Frederick of Nürnberg this so eagerly solicited liberty,
the stipulation is made that the gold gulden to be
coined should be of as good gold and weight as "the
gulden or florin of Florence."</p>

<p>In the case of Lübeck direct documentary evidence
of transactions relating to the introduction of a
gold coinage has survived among the archives of that
state. The privilege of a Mint and of coining (of
silver) was first granted to Lübeck by Frederick <span class="smcap">II.</span> in
1226. But it was not until a century and more later
that Louis the Bavarian, by his bull of 28th November<!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
1340, conceded the right of coining gold "in pieces
which were to be neither heavier nor of higher worth
than the florin of Florence." On the 8th September
in the following year the Lübeck Mint made its first
purchase of gold from a certain Jacob Grell of
Zütphen in Holland. The purchase consisted of
4 marks 1 loth 8 pfen. weight of gold (Lübeck weight),
and the price paid was 24 solidi the carat. In other
parcels, up to Michaelmas of 1341, the authorities
remitted to the Mint a total weight of metal of
50 marks 2 oz. 3 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> <span class="correction" title="corrected from 'aug.'">ang.</span>, varying in fineness from 15 to
23 carats. The consignment yielded in the pot 46
marks 1 oz. 7 ang. of pure metal, and was coined into
3199 pieces of a total weight of 47 marks 5 oz. 10 ang.,
being 67.08 gold pieces to the Lübeck mark. The
coins were issued on the 18th February 1342, and
bore on the one side the lily of Florence and on the
other the figure of John the Baptist&mdash;all in direct
imitation of the florin. The total issues made in
the immediately succeeding years from the Lübeck
Mint were:&mdash;</p>

<p>With more or less irregularity the earliest German
guldens imitated the florin, and maintained something
like a steady and uniform denomination quite up to
the beginning of the last quarter of the fourteenth
century.<!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GOLD COINAGE IN FRANCE</i></div>

<p>In France, as in Germany, the first coining of gold
can only be dated approximately, but for all practical
purposes quite safely. The generally accepted view
is that the French series of gold coins was initiated in
1254 by Louis <span class="smcap">IX.</span>, "St. Louis," and that the issue was
connected with the Sixth Crusade which he had
headed five years before. There is documentary
evidence extant to disprove this. <i>Florins d'or appelez
Florences</i> are mentioned as early as 1180, not vaguely
but quite definitely with an exact statement of weight
standard and equivalence. Unless the record of the
first minting of the gold florin at Florence is untrustworthy
the coin here referred to can only be an
imitation in gold of the silver florin of Florence. The
same document which contains this reference (De
Saulcy, i. 115) also specifies <i>petits royaux d'or</i> as
minted not only in 1180 by Philip Augustus, but also
in the days of his father, Louis <span class="smcap">VII.</span> Similar mention
of at least two gold coins of Louis <span class="smcap">IX.</span> occurs as early
as 1226, one evidently of the florin type, the other a
<i>pavillon d'or</i>. It is quite safe to assert, however,
that these coins were for show merely, due to an
emulation of Byzantine and Italian opulence, and
indicate no wide or commercial employment of gold.
Of the gold florins of 1226, for instance, thirteen
pieces were struck, twelve for twelve peers of France
as a gift, the thirteenth for the King himself, "and
know you that this is the most beautiful money that
can be found, and the finest and best engraved." The
interest of such issues is entirely numismatic and not<!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
commercial or monetary.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is not until late in the
reign of St. Louis&mdash;until 1265 or thereabouts&mdash;that
there is mention in France of any such gold coinage
as could have this commercial rather than merely
numismatic importance. For the purposes of metallic
or currency history proper the real starting-point for
France is marked rather by the <i>gros royaux d'or</i>, coined
in 1295 by Philip le Bel, than by the more meagre
coinage of St. Louis and his predecessors. The <i>gros
royaux</i> of Philip were double the value of the <i>petits
royaux</i> of St. Louis, of which latter Philip le Bel speaks
thus in his proclamation. "We have commanded to
be made in our name money of gold after the <i>petits
royaux d'or</i>, which shall be 70 to the Paris mark and
cut as the <i>petits royaux</i> have been used to be, being
issued at an equivalence of 11 sols Parisi." From
this date (1295) onward the gold coinage of the
French Mint became one of the most important
factors in the monetary history of Europe.</p>

<p>In Flanders the first gold coins were struck in
1357, under the rule of Count Louis <span class="smcap">II.</span><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Both
the coins issued by him are copied directly from
French types&mdash;&mdash;his <i>real au lion</i> from the French
<i>écu</i> of Philip <span class="smcap">IV.</span>, and his <i>mouton d'or</i> from the
French coin of the same name. And it was the same<!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
French original which furnished the types to William <span class="smcap">V.</span>,
Count of Holland (1356-77), when he followed
the fashion and coined gold. Of the six types minted
by Count William during his reign, two are an imitation
of the French <i>mouton</i>, and the last is derived
from the universally prevailing type, the florin.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GOLD COINAGE IN SPAIN AND ENGLAND</i></div>

<p>In Spain the first coining of gold by the Christian
powers fell in the same epoch and derived from the
same source. Alfonso <span class="smcap">XI.</span> (1312-50), surnamed the
"Noble," was the first King of Castille who coined
the <i>oro gran modulo</i> (<i>doblas de oro</i>), while in Aragon
Pedro <span class="smcap">IV.</span> (1336-87), "the Ceremonious," in his <i>oro
florines</i> directly imitated the Florentine type, though
his later pieces are more original in design.</p>

<p>Finally, with regard to England,&mdash;to whose
monetary history a central importance attaches,&mdash;the
course of events was most evidently controlled by
the revolution in the continental currencies. It is,
at the same time, comparatively easy to ascertain.
The first of our kings to issue gold coins was Henry
<span class="smcap">III.</span>, who in 1257 coined a penny of fine gold, of the
weight of two silver pennies of the time, and ordered
it to be current for twenty pence.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the idea of such a
coinage was derived from that of St. Louis of
France; and, just as in France, the issue seems
to have been premature. Probably neither in
the one country nor the other did there exist a
sufficient store of the precious metal itself, nor
sufficient activity of trade to attract such a store, or<!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
indeed to make a gold coinage at all a matter of
mercantile advantage. It is only a developed and
active or considerable trade that demands so
enhanced a medium of exchange. Accordingly, just
as in France, there is a noticeable gap between the
first actual minting of gold by the predecessors of St.
Louis, and the minting of it in such quantities as to
make a factor in commercial and monetary history, in
the days of Philip le Bel (1295); so, in England, the
first issue of Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> was followed by an interval
of nearly ninety years, during which no coinage of
gold by our kings took place. The real introducer of
this metal into English currency and commerce was
Edward <span class="smcap">III</span>., and the first practical issue of it is to be
dated in 1344, rather than 1257. It will be seen at
a glance what this statement implies. The issue of
Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> in 1257 had been premature&mdash;an act of
kingly rivalry and show, rather than of commercial
necessity. But the succeeding century saw a rapid
development in the commerce of Northern Europe,
and a gold coinage had gradually become both a
possibility and a necessity. One after the other&mdash;in
the order of time just detailed&mdash;the various
commercial states with which England had intercourse
had adopted it and profited by it. That
England should follow in the movement scarcely
more than sixteen years later than Germany, and
a year or two before Flanders, is some evidence of
the organisation of her trade, as well as of the
intimacy of inter-commercial relationships. So<!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
purely a matter of trade and natural growth was
this vast movement of the adoption of a gold coinage&mdash;a
revolution indeed as it proved, though yet unwritten,
more momentous in its influence on European
civilisation than either the Renaissance or the Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FIRST PERIOD</i></div>

<p>Approximately, therefore, the fourteenth century
may be taken as the starting-point for a history
of European bimetallism. The first period of that
history embraces all the movements of the previous
metals, from such starting-point up to the discovery
of America in 1492&mdash;a matter of two centuries,
roughly speaking.</p>

<p>The characteristics of this period are perfectly
well defined, and repeat themselves with almost
faithful and exact similarity of recurrence in the
several states comprising the Europe of that date.
In brief, such characteristics were those of&mdash;(1) a
period of commercial expanse, necessitating an increasing
currency and advancing prices; (2) a period
of stationary production of the precious metals,
necessitating a struggle among the various states for
the possession of those metals; (3) a period of endless
change in the ratio between gold and silver, necessitating
continual revision of the rate of exchange.
Broadly speaking, those characteristics fall into two
classes, accordingly as they relate to&mdash;(1) the natural
movement of prices <i>i.e.</i> having regard merely to the
supply of the precious metals; (2) to the unnatural
struggle for the metals themselves&mdash;for the material<!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
for currency&mdash;due to international rivalry and bad
or crafty legislation.</p>

<p>With regard to the former of these, the period
was distinctly one of insufficient and relatively diminishing
production of the metals. During these two
centuries, 1300-1500, the main sources of the derivation
of gold were the Eastern trade and the finds on
the eastern shores and northern interior of Africa.
The chief supply of silver came from the mines in
Germany. These latter&mdash;in Hungary, Transylvania,
Saxony, and Bohemia&mdash;were of such importance and
activity, in the fifteenth century and towards the
time of the discovery of America, as partially to keep
pace with the general trade expanse of the time,
thereby helping to arrest a fall of prices that would
have been absolutely disastrous to the civilisation of
Europe. The combined production during this
period cannot even be conjectured. At the close of
it&mdash;during the reign of Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>&mdash;the total coinage
of England, both silver and gold, did not probably
exceed £3,000,000, while the total stock of both
metals in Europe in 1492 has been estimated at
no more than £33,400,000. These figures stand
alone, for we have no idea of the extent of the
commerce which was worked on so small a monetary
basis, and very little idea of the amount of
aid which was extended to metallic money by
such expedients as bills of exchange. To estimate,
therefore, whether the period was one of depreciating,
stationary, or appreciating currency, we are<!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
reduced to the testimony of prices and the Mint
records.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COURSE OF MONETARY DEPRECIATION</i></div>

<p>In France, at the beginning of the period (in
1308), the mark of gold was coined into 44 livres,
and the mark of silver into 2 livres 19 sols. At the
close of the period, or towards it, in 1475, the mark
of gold was coined into 118 livres 10 sols, and that
of silver into 10 livres.</p>

<p>In Germany the mark of gold was coined into
66 gulden of 23 carats in 1386, and into 71-1&#8260;3 gulden
of 18 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> carats in 1495&mdash;a depreciation of 34.36 per
cent. In Spain the mark of silver was coined into
130 maravedis in the year 1312, and into 2210 maravedis
in 1474. This latter case is, however, so
inextricably complicated with considerations of mere,
<i>i.e.</i> arbitrary, debasement, as to render it useless for
any estimation of the natural appreciation of the
metals. In England our earliest gold coin weighed
128 <span class="above">4</span>&#8260;<span class="below">7</span> grains, and was tariffed at 6s. 8d. In 1489,
80 grains of gold were equivalent to the same,
6s. 8d.&mdash;a reduction of 37.94 per cent. Within the
same period the weight of the silver penny sank
from 22 to 12 troy grains, a reduction of 45.45 per
cent. Eliminating cases of arbitrary debasement, a
rough average for the period might fairly give 40 per
cent. of depreciation through the two centuries.</p>

<p>The case need hardly be laboured statistically, for
the legislative history of all the countries forming the
circle of commercial Europe in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries witnesses this general downward<!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
movement&mdash;this appreciation and restriction of currency&mdash;in
grim and unmistakable manner; and it is
the expression of this general movement in their legislations
that gives the test and measure of the earliest
bimetallic troubles of Europe. In many ways the
problem before the various Governments was a more
difficult one than that which besets the modern world.
There was, for instance, nothing like an equal and
generally recognised ratio of value between gold and
silver prevailing at any one single point of time. At
one and the same date a ratio of 7 or 8 to 1 prevailed
in the Moorish parts of Spain, and 12 to 1 in the
Christian parts (the kingdom of Castile). Similarly,
at a later period, in 1474, the ratio in England was
11.15, in Germany 11.12, and in France 11.00, in
Italy 10.58, and in Spain 9.82.</p>

<p>The natural result of such a state of chaos, if it
had been permitted to work itself out unhindered,
would have been arbitrage transactions of such a
nature&mdash;a flux and reflux of the European currencies
so perpetual&mdash;as would have induced a yearly
and universal bankruptcy. In spite of frantic efforts
on the part of ruler after ruler, such results did
partially come about, and they sufficiently account
both for the distraction of Governments and the
hatred universally visited upon the Jew in the Middle
Ages. The measures which were adopted by the
various States to counteract this invisible, insidious,
and wasting process, partake of the roughness and
unscientific character of the age. The export of gold<!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and silver was forbidden on pain of death; and it
was no mere paper threat, for prominent London
merchants were drawn and quartered for the offence.
The rates of exchange of foreign coins were fixed by
proclamation, and the office of exchanger limited to
a particular place. When all this proved ineffectual,
the coins were cried down, and violent and sudden
changes in the ratio enacted. What made the jerk
and friction of such a process worse was that such
measures were not merely defensive, but intentionally
offensive. The wish of the fourteenth and fifteenth
century ruler was not merely to defend his own stock
of precious metals from depletion, but&mdash;having gained
the conviction of the insufficiency of the production
of those metals for the needs of Europe&mdash;to attract
to himself the stock of his neighbours by whatever
craft. There was a general struggle for the coverlid
of gold, and the methods of that struggle were
almost barbaric in their rudeness, violence, craft, and
dishonourableness.</p>



<h5>Italy.</h5>

<p>On account of their knowledge and practice of
the science of exchanges and finance, the metallic
history of the Italian states is of chief importance for
this earliest period. At a time when the northern
nations show signs of an infancy of commerce merely,
Italy was advanced in the art and practice of a most
highly developed commercial and financial state. It
is to her that we owe our system of book-keeping and<!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the use of bills of exchange, not to speak of the
pawnbroking and funding systems; and it is permissible
to conjecture that Italy, keeping her finger as
she did on the monetary pulsations of Europe, reaped
her harvest, and far the largest harvest, from the
bimetallic fluctuations of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries. In their turn those fluctuations acted on
herself, and occasionally disastrously. On account of
their pre-eminence as the commercial states of the
peninsula, Florence and Venice are chosen to illustrate
in brief the monetary history of Italy. The
account of the general course of depreciation in both
these states, and of the fluctuations of Mint rates is
given in the Appendix (Nos. <a href="#Page_301">I.</a> and <a href="#Page_310">II.</a>). As regards
the bimetallic influence of these changes of rates, there
is one telling record in the history of Florence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE FLORENTINE TROUBLES OF 1345</i></div>

<p>The second quarter of the fourteenth century
witnessed a decided rise in the value of silver as
against gold. It told immediately upon Florence, on
account of her Mint rates. By the regulation of
1324 the ratio in Florence was 13.62, whereas in
France the ratio was approximately 12.6, and twenty
years later, 1344, hardly more than 11 in both France
and England. The result on Florence was immediate,
and silver disappeared from circulation. In 1345,
says her historian, Villani, there was great scarcity.
There was no silver money with the exception of the
<i>quattrini</i>. It was all melted down and transported.
Silver of the alloy of 11 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> oz. fine was worth in other
parts out of Florence more than 12 <i>lire a fiorino</i>,<!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
whence arose great discontent to the woollen
merchants, who feared that the gold florin, in which
they received their foreign payments, should fall
too much. Being a powerful factor in the little
state, they agitated, and the recoinage of 1345
was the result. The precedent evil and the
remedy applied by this recoinage may be thus
illustrated:&mdash;</p>

<p>By law&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="The precedent evil and the
remedy applied by this recoinage may be thus

</table>

<p>The silver species current in Florence in 1345 were
<i>quattrini</i> and <i>Guelfi del fiore</i>. These coins were
of the same standard as above (11 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> oz.), were
coined at a tale of 167 to the libbra, and issued at
an equivalence of 30 piccioli. The libbra of this
silver, therefore, by Florentine Mint rate was valued
at 20 <i>lire</i> 17 <i>soldi</i> 6 <i>denari di piccioli</i>. Abroad,
therefore, the price of silver was a matter of slightly
more than 5 lire higher than in Florence.</p>

<p>The same result could be got by taking the billon
money of Florence and calculating from its silver
contents.<!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>The natural result was a disappearance of silver.
The only remedy was a recoinage, and this was
applied by the law of 19th August 1345. By this
law the standard of 11 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> oz. was retained, the tale of
the <i>Grossi</i> was increased to 134 pieces to the libbra
(132 being rendered to the merchant, and 2 retained
for Mint expenses), and each piece issued at an equivalence
of 4 soldi.</p>

<p class="center">
4 x 132 = 528 soldi.<br />
(= 26 lire 8 soldi di piccioli.)<br />
</p>

<p>It will be seen at a glance that this equalised the
internal and external price of silver.</p>

<p>Rather strangely this enactment of the 19th of
August was followed by another no more than four
days later (23rd August 1345), by which a slight
reactionary change was made in favour of silver. The
tale was decreased from 134 to 132 pieces, to be struck
from the libbra of the same standard, and issuable at
the same equivalence.</p>

<p>Slight as the backward change was, it was
sufficient to leave the monetary system exposed to the
same influence of differential exchanging, and within
two months it had to be repealed by the law of October
1345. Under the name of <i>Nuovi Guelfi</i> a fresh coin
was thereby instituted of the same standard and
equivalence as above, but at a tale of 142 per libbra
(140 being rendered back to the merchant, and 2
retained for expenses of coinage).</p>

<p class="center">
140 x 4 = 560 piccioli.<br />
(= 28 lire di piccioli.)<br />
<!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>This established a considerable advantage, and turned
the flow of silver back again to Florence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FLORENCE IN 1345</i></div>

<p>The process might in many respects be compared
to our raising of the bank rate, were it not that the
two operations represent quite different and separated
financial epochs. It is noteworthy, too, because the
process will be found immediately imitated in both
France and England, that these laws of 1345 represent
preponderatingly the sense of the class of
exchangers of Florence,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the financiers professed,&mdash;men
who would profit individually in their exchange
operations as much as the state would in its restored
currency of silver. "The above lords," says the
preamble to the first-cited Act, "considering the
numerous petitions made to them by many artificers,
merchants, and honourable citizens, of the incredible
lack of silver money in the state of Florence, on
account of which the citizens of the said state suffer
many inconveniences and wants, have determined to
have and have had counsel of the twenty-one guilds
of the city, who have [by a roundabout method]
chosen eight men, skilled and prudent in the aforesaid,
who have had counsel with the officers of our Mint
and with certain others of the trade of exchangers,"
etc., with such result as above.</p>

<p>Yet even so, the effort was only temporarily
successful. Before two years was out the price of
silver abroad, outside of Florence, had advanced to
12 <i>lire</i> 15 <i>soldi a fiorino</i> = 27 <i>lire</i> 14 <i>soldi di piccioli</i>,
whereas the price fixed by a fresh Mint law of 1345 had<!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
been again reduced to under 26 <i>lire</i> 10 <i>soldi di piccioli</i>.
The result was a second melting down and disappearance
of the silver coins of the state, a second agitation
on the part of the Florentine woollen merchants, and
renewed legislation.</p>

<p>By the Mint regulation of 1347, a new-named
money was introduced called <i>Guelfi Grossi</i>, coined at
a tale of 117 to the libbra (111 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">5</span> being rendered cash
to the merchants, and 5 <span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">5</span> retained by the Mint for the
state), at the same standard as before (11 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> oz.), but
at an equivalence of 5 instead of, as previously, 4
piccioli per piece.</p>

<p class="center">
117 x 5 = 585 piccioli.<br />
(= 29 lire 5 soldi di piccioli);<br />
</p>

<p>a figure which is considerably above the 27 <i>lire</i> 14
<i>soldi piccioli</i>, which Villani gives as the price of
foreign silver at the time. Even taking the lower tale
of 111 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">5</span> pieces, which the importer of silver to the
Mint got for his bullion, there is a distinct margin of
profit.</p>

<p class="center">
111 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">5</span> = 558 piccioli.<br />
(= 27 lire 18 soldi di piccioli.)<br />
</p>

<p>Indeed, in its entirety, this operation of 1347 has a
sinister look. At home the woollen merchants of
Florence were obliged to pay wages in silver, abroad
to receive payment in gold. It was to their interest
to cry down the equivalence of silver; they paid less
and received more. The means by which they
brought the state to put upon silver a price so far
removed from the market price could only be the bribe<!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
contained in the relinquishing of 5 <span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> pieces in each
libbra. But such a process is in reality the beginning
of debasement.</p>

<p>If this is not the true import of the Act of 1347,
it testifies all the more to the only other possible
motive&mdash;the monetary straits of Florence, her want of
silver for currency, and the violent effort she was
prepared to make to get it.</p>

<p>Whether by way of effect or cause it is hard to
say, but certainly silver in the middle of the succeeding
century had so far disappeared in the Italian
peninsula, or gold so far increased during the fifteenth
century, that the commercial ratio remained persistently
low&mdash;1: 9.25, both in Milan and Florence; and
the Mint regulations of 1460 adopted by the latter
state (see under <a href="#Page_306">table of Florentine silver coins</a>,
Appendix), can only be looked upon as a simple
repetition of the measures of 1345 and 1347.</p>



<h5>Spain.</h5>

<p>The currency history of Spain up to the conquest
of America is one long list of alterations in the
coinage, and of petitions from merchants and various
Cortes for or against changes in the rating of the
coins. The <i>oro gran modulo</i> was rated at 100
pesetas, under Alfonso <span class="smcap">XI.</span> of Castile, 1312-50, and at
1000 under his successor, Peter the Cruel, 1350-69.
The <i>oro dobla Castellana</i> was rated at 60 pesetas
under Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span>, 1369-74; at 40 under Henry the
Crafty, 1390-1406; and at 100 under John <span class="smcap">II.</span>,<!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
1406-54. In the case of this country the troubles in
the fourteenth century arose from the proximity of
France, the circulation of lower-rated French coins,
and the consequent depletion of the treasure of the
kingdom. In Aragon, for instance, the charter of
Peter <span class="smcap">IV.</span> in 1346 had ordered the coining of gold after
the same weight and fineness as of the florin of
Florence. It was found too high, and three years
later he was obliged to cancel it by another proclamation,
ordering his own gold coins to be made of the
same weight and fineness as the <i>écus</i> of the French
kings. The close of his reign and the early part of
that of his successor witnessed acute crisis and distress,
which led to Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span>'s celebrated reduction of
the coinage at the Cortes of Medina del Campo in
1371.</p>

<p>In 1391-93 another general proclamation was
issued, ordering a reduction of the value of the
monies and fixing new rules of exchange, and this was
followed by one in 1398, prohibiting the circulation of
foreign coins in Spain, except at bullion value. This
latter was a common device, as will be seen in the case
of our own country. It proved ineffectual to prevent
the outflow of the metals, and when re-enacted in
1413 was found to be of as little avail. The Cortes
of 1442 (Valladolid) complained bitterly, in a petition,
of the money drawn away from the realm by foreign
merchants, and in the same year a fresh ordinance was
issued to readjust the values of the native monies to the
foreign coins. In this schedule, <i>doblas de la Banda</i><!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
were rated at 100 <i>maravedis</i>, and the <i>florin d'oro
d'Aragon</i> at 65 <i>maravedis</i>. In 1473, only thirty or so
years later, by the charter of Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span>, issued at
Segovia, these coins were rated at 300 and 200
<i>maravedis</i> respectively. It was only with the advent
of the Catholic sovereigns that the internal disorder
and want of unity of the Spanish system was effectually
remedied, in the very hour of that discovery of a
new world which was to put upon Spain the vital
function of distributing the new stores of precious
metals (see account of Spanish monies, <a href="#Page_319">Appendix III.</a>).</p>

<h5>Germany.</h5>

<p>The movements of the precious metals in
Germany&mdash;which, as far as the ratio of the two
metals is concerned, may be held to include the
Netherlands up to 1552, when Flanders withdrew
from the monetary system of the Holy Roman
Empire&mdash;is a record of exactly the same process of
natural and gradual appreciation of the <i>metal</i> (<i>i.e.</i>
depreciation of the weight and fineness of the <i>coin</i>)
as in Spain, France, and England. In the accompanying
tables the movement of silver is illustrated
by means of the groschen, and that of gold
by the Rhenish gulden. These coins, it need hardly
be said, were not unit coins, nor sole prevailing.
They are chosen from the bewildering variety with
which the numerous independent Mints of Germany
have succeeded in perplexing posterity, as being of
relatively greater repute and wider acceptance, and<!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
because it is a simply impossible task to combine all
the denominations of these coins, in order to deduce
an average.</p>

<p>Up to 1375 the German gold coin was minted in
close imitation of the Florentine florin. The weight
was 53 grs., as was that of the Florentine piece;
and the lily and St. John, the guardian saint of
Florence, were both employed in the two coins, the
German piece being indeed issued at first under the
denomination, <i>Florin d'or</i>.</p>

<p>From the above-named date, however, and onwards,
each succeeding and various power altered
type, weight, or alloy, with more or less arbitrariness,
but always to the increasing of the confusion of the
system as a whole. And it was to remedy this
confusion, or to reduce it somewhat, that the
monetary union of the four electoral princes of the
Rhine was established (8th June 1386), under the
lead of the three towns, Frankfort, Speyer, and
Worms; under which the four princes, Frederick,
Archbishop of Cologne, Carl, Archbishop of Treves,
Adolf, Archbishop of Mainz, and Rupert, Count
Palatine of the Rhine, agreed upon a common minting
of gold gulden. According to the treaty, 66 such
gulden were to be minted from the Cologne mark of
gold, each of the alloy of 22 carats 6 grs. gold,
and 1 carat 6 grs. silver. In 1402 this coinage was
confirmed at Mainz by the Mint edict of Rupert <span class="smcap">II.</span><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
<p><!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<p>Seven years later, 1409, the three spiritual
electors, Frederick, Archbishop of Cologne, John,
Archbishop of Mainz, and Werner, Archbishop of
Treves, made a new and slightly different treaty, for
the purpose of again reducing the alloy of the gulden
from 22 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> to 22 carats.</p>

<p>At this rate the system was, in the same year, at
Speyer, formally accepted for themselves by the
Netherlands, and at Cologne also, in 1409, by the
Empire generally.</p>

<p>The detailed and various changes which the
independent princes and powers of Germany subsequently
made, it is out of the question to follow.
To instance only in brief. In 1419 Frederick of
Brandenburg ordered the coining of gulden for his
own states, at the rate of 64 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> to the Cologne mark,
and of the fineness of 19 carats&mdash;a very considerable
reduction in the metal value of the coin. In 1422,
only three years later, Sigismund was coining gulden
66 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> to the mark and 22 carats 6 grs. fine&mdash;a value
somewhat higher than that accepted for the empire in
1409. In 1428-29, accordingly, the Emperor Sigismund
issued an imperial order, which was formally
adopted by the Reichstag meeting at Eger (1437) and
Nürnberg (1438), by which the Cologne mark was to
be coined into 68 gulden and the fineness reduced to
19 carats. Four years later, 1442, the Emperor
Frederick <span class="smcap">IV.</span> projected a further reform and reduction,
proposing to coin 72 pieces of 19 carats fine, but
this was not carried into effect, probably as exaggerat<!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>ing
the average depreciation of the content of the coin
(or appreciation of the metal). The rate, therefore,
established by Sigismund practically remained in force
for a matter of sixty years.</p>

<p>In the diet of 1495-97 (at Worms), however, a
further slight reduction in weight and fineness took
place, 69 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> pieces being struck out of the Cologne
mark, and the fineness lowered to 18 carats 10 grs.</p>

<p>On the whole, therefore, the movement of gold
during these two centuries is remarkably sluggish in
Germany, putting aside, <i>i.e.</i>, the internal variations
between state and state; and remarkably corresponding
to, and confirmatory of, that in England. And in
all probability the mean of the quantities in the two
countries would aptly measure the perfectly natural or
normal appreciation of gold (depreciation of the
content of fine metal in the current gold coin)
throughout the period.</p>

<p>The movement of silver during the same two
hundred years, 1300-1500, is much more excited, but
shows an average or mean appreciation that tallies
remarkably with that of gold just described, as
also with that of silver in England. The various
denominations of silver coins which arose in Germany,
in those years, make it a work of extreme difficulty
even to attempt averages. In the accompanying
tables, therefore, the groschen is taken as most
fairly averaging and widely current in the empire.
In its first form, the <i>Gros Tournois</i>, struck at Tours,
in France, this coin contained 55 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">10</span> parts of a<!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Cologne mark, and was of the fineness of 15 loth
6 grs. In 1296, when it was first adopted in
Germany (in Bohemia, and Meissen), 63 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> pieces were
struck from the mark, and the fineness had been
reduced to 15 loth. Its subsequent variations, up to
the time of the discovery of America, are detailed in
the accompanying table and in <a href="#Page_360">Appendix No. V.</a>, the
principal points in which are marked by the years
1341, 1378 (a notable attempt at reformation by
Charles <span class="smcap">IV.</span> and Wenceslaus), 1390, 1412, and 1444
(marking also an attempt at reformation by treaty
between the Duke of Saxony and the Margrave of
Meissen).<!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>France presents the utmost difficulty to the student
of metallic money during this earliest period, by
reason of these violent and arbitrary alterations of the
coinage. The extreme diversity of the coins, and the
perpetual changing of the composition or alloy, make
it almost impossible to estimate the fluctuations in
the value of money in relation to goods, or gold in
relation to silver. Apart from the international
struggle for the precious metals, France was torn and
ruined by the English invasions, and debasement
after debasement of the coinage was resorted to as a
means of raising money to continue the struggle.
Such debasements mark the reign of Philip le Bel,
1285-1314, and of each succeeding king, from his
days to the final ejection of the English invaders, and
after. A single instance will serve to show their
nature. In 1342 the mark of gold, which in a
normal time just preceding was valued at 41 livres
13 sols, was proclaimed equal to 117 livres, and in
1360 the mark of silver, valued normally at 5 livres,
rose to 102 livres.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It stands to reason that such
abnormal movements must be neglected in any
attempt to determine the course of such fluctuations
in value of the metals, and the ratio of gold and silver,
as arose naturally from the metallic and currency
history of the time. Eliminating, therefore, this
element of forced and accidental debasements, due to
political circumstance, the natural history, if it may<!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
be so styled, of the French coinage displays the
same tendency to an appreciation of money metal
which marks the history of the other European
countries.</p>

<p>In this table each of the points or dates taken
marks a period of return to good money after a
period of debasement, and in the mind of the
legislator such return to good money (<i>monnaie
forte</i>) can only be construed as based on an estimated
general or normal rate of monetary values,
for each particular succeeding point of time. At<!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
every return to good money a proclamation was issued,
expressing the determination of the administration to
adhere to good money, as in the halcyon days of St.
Louis, etc. etc., and fixing the rate at which the
monies should be coined and current. By taking
these points or dates of return to good money,
therefore, we eliminate the arbitrary action of the
Government in periods of debasement, and arrive at
a net result showing the <i>natural</i> movement of the
metals.</p>

<p>The general trend of the table&mdash;or of the metals
whose movements it portrays&mdash;is perceptible at a
glance, and will, moreover, be found exactly similar to
that of the cases of England and Germany below.
On account of the arbitrary debasements by the
Kings and of the numerous feudal coinages struck
independently by the bishops and subsidiary lords,
the question of the friction with which this process
of metallic appreciation worked itself out cannot
be so well illustrated in the case of France as
in that of England. But so much as this may be
briefly indicated. In 1294 the scarcity of silver
coinage was so great that a proclamation was put
forth ordering silver to be brought to the Mint, and
forbidding the export of the metals. In consequence
of the futility of this ordinance, a further proclamation
was issued in 1309, forbidding the circulation in
France of English silver sterlings and gold florins of
Florence, and crying down the exchange denomination
of all other foreign coins. Similar proclama<!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>tions
were issued again and again&mdash;notably in 1328.
But the complaints as to the depletion of the coin of
the realm became much more serious in France after
Edward III. had instituted his gold coin in 1344.
There was henceforth a process of double friction&mdash;(1)
as arising from the difference of the declared value of
the French King's coin, as compared with foreign
tariffs of coins; (2) as arising from the difference
between the ratio of gold to silver in France and that
prevailing in other countries.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ALTERATION IN SILVER RATE</i></div>

<p>In 1336 Philippe de Valois had fixed the ratio at
1:12, "the cause which moved us to this being that
so our people who were in great privations and straits
for money may more abundantly and quickly be filled
again with money new and current." This was re-enacted
in 1339, but proved quite inoperative to rule
the market rate, and in 1346 Philippe found himself
obliged to tolerate the advance which had been put
upon the good monies in the market, by allowing
provisionally the <i>chaise d'or</i> to be current for 30 sols
Tournois. Four years later the silver rate was
altered by a proclamation conceived in these terms:
"As the changers and merchants who are accustomed
to bring bullion to our Mint have ceased, and do daily
cease to do so, so that the working of our Mint is
greatly impeded, to the great prejudice of our people
if no remedy is applied, we therefore order that for
each mark of silver brought to the Mint there shall
be delivered out by the Mint another 8 sols Tournois
in addition to the 112 sols Tournois fixed by law."<!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
The immediate consequence was a hoarding and
disappearance of the gold coins, and in the following
year, 1351, the tale of the <i>denier d'or aux fleurs de lis</i>
was altered from 50 to 54 to the mark.</p>

<p>There is here no question of an arbitrary debasement.
It was simply an attempt to preserve the
currency from the action of a changing market ratio,
which led to the withdrawal now of the one, now of
the other coins, and to the circulation meanwhile of
foreign coins at a rate apparently disproportioned to
the metallic content.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In 1361 evidence was given
before the Mint authorities that "in payments the
people do by abuse give foreign monies at a higher
rate than they are worth, viz. the <i>moutons</i> of Flanders
and Brabant at a higher rate than the <i>franc d'or</i>, of
which said <i>moutons</i> the best specimens are worth 18
denars less than the said <i>franc d'or</i>; a silver piece
called <i>chartain</i> for 16 and even 18 denars, which is
worth no more than 10," and so on. Two years
later it was declared that the Mint at Tournay was on
the point of stopping work, "the people having been
accustomed for a long time to give a higher price for
the mark of gold than in the case of other monies of
this kingdom, and this by reason of the foreign
merchants." Towards the close of his reign
Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span>, finding his kingdom filled with depreciated
imported specie, while all the good native pieces had
been drawn out of the land, sought and obtained
from the Pope, 1372, a Bull of Excommunication<!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
against neighbour powers who should counterfeit his
monies. It was not until 1391 that the proper
defensive measure of a change of ratio was resorted
to, and by that time the conditions of the Mint rates
in surrounding nations had so altered as to render
the change partially inoperative. In 1393, accordingly,
there was a great lack of the smaller silver coin, which
led to a proclamation by Charles <span class="smcap">VI.</span> on the 2nd April
of that year for encouraging the minting of <i>petiz
deniers Tournois</i>. The same complaint was, however,
re-echoed in 1395 and 1396, but, as it appears,
quite futilely, for nine years after another proclamation
had to be issued against the currency of foreign coins
of Scotland, Navarre, the Rhenish and Netherland
provinces, etc., "which have course in our kingdom
for a greater value than they are worth, by which
means our monies are arrested in their course and
greatly withdrawn; the gold and silver <i>deniers a
l'écu</i> which we have minted having been melted
down."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ACTION OF THE STATES-GENERAL IN 1420</i></div>

<p>When the States-General met at Paris in 1420 the
depreciated state of the coinage was laid before the
assembly as of prime concernment, and it was by its
advice that the proclamation of the following year
was issued fixing the <i>écu d'or</i> at a tale of 66 to the
mark and of the <i>gros d'argent</i> at 86 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>, "it being
come to our knowledge that for some time past the
money in our kingdom is so diminished and enfeebled
that by this means the gold and silver which abounded
is in very great measure drawn away and transported,<!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and the traffic of strangers here almost ceased, and
all necessaries of life put at a great height," etc.
The result of this reformation of 1421 was that during
some portion of the succeeding years of Charles <span class="smcap">VII.</span>'s
reign silver came from all parts in great abundance,
although in 1436 complaints were again heard that
money was not being coined and did not suffice for
the public needs. At this point, however, the complaints
apparently ceased, and it was not till twenty
years later that the step was again taken of decrying
and forbidding the circulation of foreign specie.</p>

<p>The ceasing of the disorders in the French money
is attributed to the expulsion of the English invaders,
but there can be little doubt that much more simple
and natural laws were at work. From the reign of
Louis <span class="smcap">XI.</span> onwards these natural laws had freer play
as against the disturbing influence of mere arbitrary
debasements, and it is easier to analyse their influence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRANCE IN 1488</i></div>

<p>From his accession in 1461 onwards the monetary
history of France displays many analogies with that
of the Netherlands (see <a href="#Page_61">Chapter II.</a>). Thus in 1470,
finding the market rate of foreign coins driven above
the home Mint rate by the licence of the people
(<i>i.e.</i> by normal market action), Louis issued a tariff to
regulate the exchange rate in which the prevailing
prices of the foreign specie were tolerated as an
interim for a period of three months. At the end of
that time it was manifestly impossible to secure a
permanent reduction, and in order to prevent the<!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
transport of specie it was found necessary, 4th January
1473, to raise the value of the home coin both
gold and silver (see account of French monies in
<a href="#Page_396">Appendix No. VI.</a>). Still the export continued, and
in 1475 the process of enhancement had to be
repeated as a measure of defence for the gold specie.
Thirteen years later similar precautions were taken
for the silver specie by Charles <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>'s proclamation of
24th April 1488.</p>

<p>This is the last defensive measure of the first
period of the monetary history of France, and no
further act is on record previous to the great change
in the relative values of the precious metals which
ensued upon the discovery of the New World.<!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND: COINAGE OF 1344</i></div>


<h5><span class="smcap">England.</span></h5>

<p>Even before the adoption of a gold coinage by
Edward <span class="smcap">III.</span>, England had felt the effect of loss by
exchange, owing to the introduction of gold florins by
means of the Flemish trade. In the Parliament of
1339, at Westminster, complaint was made of the
want of coinage. It was proposed as a remedy&mdash;(1)
that every merchant should bring in 40s. or more for
every sack of wool that he should import, and (2) that
it should be considered by the King and his council
whether it might not be advantageous to permit
<i>florins de écu</i> (of France), and florins of Florence
(<i>i.e.</i> gold), and other good florins to be current with
the <i>esterlings</i> (<i>i.e.</i> the silver penny), "but only
esterlings to be compulsory for under 40s. value."
In less than four years good money was being carried
out of the realm, and false money brought in at such a
rate that Parliament was seriously perplexed. In its
debate on the matter at Westminster, 1343, the result
is thus stated: "All orders of persons in the realm
had loss for a long time, on account of the florins
which were delivered in payment in Flanders, bearing
so high a value there as to occasion a loss of one-third
on all merchandise imported thence." Certain goldsmiths
of London were therefore ordered to be called
in to advise and to refine one or two of each kind of
florin, so as to rate the fine gold in them according to
the true value. And it was proposed that of this
fine gold one kind of money should be made in<!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
England and Flanders, provided the Flemings were
willing, to be current in both countries at such an alloy
and value as should be determined by the King and
Council, and all other gold money to be taken at
bullion value, and all silver money to be reckoned
thereby ("other sufficient money to be received
according to the value of the fine gold").</p>

<p>The result was the first practical issue of English
gold. In 1344 an indenture was made between the
King on the one part and George Kirkyn and Lotte
Nicholyn of Florence, goldmasters and workers, on
the other, for the coining of three monies of gold, one
to be current at 6s., and to be equal in weight to 2
<i>petits florins</i> of Florence of good weight, 50 of these
being coined out of the pound Tower of London.</p>

<p>In this indenture Edward copied the ratio prevailing
in the French kingdom, viz. that of 12.61 to 1
between gold and silver. That ratio was considerably
too high, and he quickly experienced the same effects
which were felt by the French King from it. During
his reign (1327-50) Philip of Valois coined more
species of new money than all his predecessors put
together, but owing to the adoption of this too high
a ratio the country was gradually depleted of good
money. In order to induce people to bring bullion to
the Mint he offered to coin free of cost, but found
nothing of avail until he followed the example of
England and altered the ratio.</p>

<p>In our own country the same truth had been quickly
grasped. It was found that the new gold money was<!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
rated too high, <i>i.e.</i> overvalued in relation to silver,
and was therefore refused. By a proclamation of the
same year, therefore, 9th July, it was withdrawn and
ordered to be taken only as bullion, and a new
indenture was made for the coining of gold nobles&mdash;39 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>
out of the pound Tower, and at the value of
6s. 8d. The nobles were at once made current and
tenderable along with silver, by proclamation; gold
being ordered to be received in payment of 20s. and
upwards.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GOLD NOBLES COINED</i></div>

<p>By this indenture the ratio was at once dropped
from 12.59:1 to 11.04:1. This attempt to determine
the rate of exchange is a common feature in the
legislation of France and Spain as well as of England.
It stands to sense, and is apparent on every page of
the monetary history of the period, that it was
absolutely imperative. The friction which accompanied
the process can now only faintly be imagined,
but that is a secondary consideration. The essential
point was, that such changes were normal and inevitable,
forced by sheer necessity upon Governments,
such an one even as our own, which has always been
most jealously conservative in matters of coinage.<!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first issue of Edward <span class="smcap">III.</span> the Troy grain of
gold had been valued at .6666 of a penny. At such
rate it was overvalued and refused, and in the second
issue of the same year the value was dropped to .5777
of a penny. Gradually, as the ratio on the Continent
changed, and came to bear on the English rate, this
was in its turn found an under-valuation, and only two
years later, 1346, the value was raised to .6222,
making a ratio of 11.57 to 1. The change was made
in consequence of loud and serious complaints of the
scarcity of coin, good money being carried out and
false "Lusshebournes" (Luxembourgs), worth only 8s.
in the pound, being brought in. The grievance was so
great that Parliament petitioned Edward most urgently
to interfere, instancing in special the Lombards,<!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
"that they purchased English florins at a lower rate
than that which was appointed," and praying "that
such persons should not buy or sell the said money, nor
make any agreement, in the sale of their merchandise,
what money they would receive in rejection of English
money." To this it was answered, that it should be commanded
throughout England that all persons should
receive for their merchandise gold, according to the
currency ordained, without any agreement to be made,
under pain of imprisonment and heavy ransom, and
when any agreement had been made it should be at
the will of the purchaser to pay money of gold or
silver as he should think fit. At the same time, an
ordinance was issued forbidding any person to carry
out the King's good money or to bring in counterfeit.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDWARD III.'S CHANGES OF RATIO</i></div>

<p>The effect of Edward's change of ratio&mdash;from
12.59 (the same as the French rate) in 1344 to 11.04
in 1346&mdash;told immediately on the French currency,
and at the first return to good money in the first year
of King John (1350-64) the ratio in that country was
changed at a stroke from 12.61 to 11.11. This in its
turn acted upon precious metals in England, and for
three years the English King found himself futilely
struggling against an outflow of silver, by such
measures as the hanging and drawing of merchants,
before he discovered that it was due to an overvaluation
of gold. In 1353, accordingly, he lowered
the weight of the gold nobles from 128 <span class="above">4</span>&#8260;<span class="below">7</span> grs. to 120.
At the same time, the contents of the silver penny
were reduced in a greater proportion (from 20 grs.<!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
to 18). By this means the ratio of 11.04, which
had prevailed since 1346, was lowered to 11.15.</p>

<p>That this ratio achieved its purpose, as far as
England was concerned, is apparent from the simple
fact that it remained unaltered for over sixty years
until 1414; that it acted adversely upon and drained
France of her gold is apparent from the change of the
ratio there at her first immediately succeeding return
to good money. Two periods of debasement had
marked the short reign of John of France (1350-64),
and the effect of these and of the influence of the
English ratio was such that in 1360 there was no
gold in his kingdom. Towards the end of that year,
and in the beginning of 1361, John promulgated a
reformation of the coinage&mdash;a return to good or
"forte" money, and in this reformation he adopted a
ratio which would act on the English stock of precious
metals.</p>

<p>In England, Edward's action in 1353 in lowering
the contents of both silver and gold coins, and altering
the ratio, had given rise to great discontent, to
an extent which proved how wiser and truer to the
nation's interest was the King than his people. This
diminution of the value of these coins, says the
Chronicle, made all things dearer, so that the workmen
and servants became assuming and demanded
greater wages.</p>

<p>There is as little foundation for such an innuendo
as there is for the view which regards this depreciation
as an issue of base money. It was simply a<!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
measure of precaution, as stopping an invisible and
insidious outflow of the currency.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND AND FRANCE IN 1360</i></div>

<p>Looked at historically, and not at all controversially,
such results as have been just described can
only be attributed to the European monetary system
of the time. Apart altogether from the arbitrary
debasement of the coin, as, <i>e.g.</i>, in France&mdash;apart
even from changes of the ratio enacted with the mere
crafty design of inducing a flow of gold, the monetary
system of the time was so rough, so unscientific; the
tariffing of the coins of different nations against each
other was so inexact, so much a matter of rule-of-thumb,
of hasty average, that it was simply impossible
to issue such general tables of equivalents of coins
and such a ratio as would have given stability to the
various coinages of Europe. If the currency system
of England had been of silver alone, a single enactment
lessening the content of the unit coin, or crying
up its denomination, would have stopped any outflow
caused by under-valuation as compared with foreign
money value. The same if it had been only gold.
But being combined of the two, being, as it was, both
gold and silver, it was necessary, in the case of such
outflow, not merely to call down one or both of them
below the value of foreign gold or silver, but also
and at the same time to establish such a ratio between
the two metals for <i>internal</i> circulation as would give
no advantage to exchangers acquainted with a different
ratio prevailing in some particular part of the
Continent. And just the same for the other European<!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
money systems. If, for instance, the English sterling
had been called down to a value which would of itself
have forbidden export to the Continent, but at the
same time such a ratio had been left standing between
these sterlings and the gold nobles (say 12:1) as
was so far in excess of the ratio prevailing in some
parts of Europe (say 11:1) as to overlap the amount
by which the sterling had been called down, then the
result could, and doubtless would, be an outflow of
silver, in face and spite of the apparent higher tariff
of the English sterling, as against the continental
silver coins. This is the historic, patent, undeniable
defect and weakness in the bimetallic system of the
Europe of that day. It must be borne well in mind
how different the problem then was from that which
now besets the monetary world. To-day the flow
of the precious metals is natural, the indicator,
facilitator, and safety-valve of international trade. Such
a conception was an utter impossibility to the fourteenth
century. The rulers of that age had only one
idea, the maintenance or increase of the treasure of
the realm, first for military purposes, and then for
trade; and their mental horizon was limited by the
boundaries of each their little dominion. They could
not grasp the idea of Europe as a monetary whole,
each fought for his own head or land, and each found
a ready weapon to hand in the monetary confusion of
the time. In any system so rough and so non-uniform
as that of Europe in the fourteenth century, any
variation of one metal served as a vantage-point against<!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the other, as a lever to press upon and force it out.
One metal would have been safe (so long as no partial
depreciation was allowed), two metals served
simply as fulcra to each other's oscillations, to the
undoing of both. The mediæval legislator could not
grasp that there was a double train of principle and
event transacting itself under his very eyes&mdash;the one,
changes of denomination of coins; the other, changes
of ratio. In less than thirty years after Edward <span class="smcap">III.</span>
had cried down the English coins to below the
competing denominations of the Continent, the changes
of the European ratio had produced their effect, and
Richard <span class="smcap">II.</span> found the realm denuded of its treasure
and currency.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND IN 1378</i></div>

<p>From 1360 the ratio on the Continent gradually
sank from 12:1 till towards the end of the first
quarter of the fifteenth century, when it stood in
France as low as 9:1.</p>

<p>That France experienced the process, which must
have been perfectly natural and due simply to relatively
diminishing production of silver in those years,
1360-1425, is seen in her alteration of the ratio from
12 to 10.74 in 1380 and to 10.29 in 1422.</p>

<p>In England the same train of events made itself
felt at almost the same moment. In 1378 great
complaints were made of the export of gold and silver,
and of the enfeebled state of the money which remained
in the realm, "so that if a remedy be not speedily
applied, the King will receive no more than 4s. where
he should receive 5s."<!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE MONETARY INQUIRY OF 1381</i></div>

<p>Three years later&mdash;one year after the French King
had lowered his ratio from 12.1 to 10.74&mdash;the Commons
presented a petition to the King during the
sitting of Parliament, 1381, complaining of the
wretched want of the kingdom, which was devoid of
treasure, monies of gold and silver being carried out
of the realm, and those remaining being clipped to
one-third their nominal value. No money at all was
being minted in the Tower, and a heavy export of
our metals to Scotland and Ireland was taking place.
Simultaneously the officers of the Mint presented a
petition to the King and his Council in Parliament,
complaining that no money was being coined. The
causes of this, in their opinion, were&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That the monies of gold and silver beyond the
seas were more feeble than the monies of England,
on which account the merchants could not bring
bullion into England for their profit nor for the King's
advantage. But if any manner of bullion of gold were
brought into the kingdom, by persons travelling, it was
sold to those who conveyed it out of England, to their
great gain and to the injury of the whole realm.</p>

<p>2. That the silver of England which [<i>i.e.</i> when it]
was found to be good and heavy, was taken into Scotland,
because the money of that country was so light.</p>

<p>3. That the gold of England being so good and
heavy, and that beyond sea so light, the <i>nobles</i> which
came from Calais were gone into Flanders, and the
English <i>nobles</i> were carried beyond the sea, to the
great profit of those who exported them, etc. etc.<!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>4. That the money of gold and silver of England
was commonly clipped, so that they who thought they
should have £100 would have no more than £90,
unless a remedy were speedily applied.</p>

<p>The officers of the Mint were accordingly ordered
to be called before the Lords of the Parliament for
examination, and they were succeeded by others,
private persons but mostly goldsmiths, who were
called upon as experts. In the case of these latter
the various statements of opinion are preserved for
us in the Rolls of Parliament, and they possess a
peculiar interest.</p>

<p>Richard Leye thought that the reason why no
gold or silver was brought into England, but, on
the contrary, that which had been in the kingdom
was exported, was this, that the realm expended too
much on merchandise, such as grocery, mercery, furs,
etc. He therefore proposed that every merchant who
imported goods into England should export an equal
quantity of the produce of the realm, and that no one
should take out gold or silver, contrary to the statutes.</p>

<p>As to the gold not agreeing with the silver (which
was Article IV. of the inquiry), he thought that could
not be remedied, unless the money were changed, and
to change it in any manner would be productive of
universal injury to Lords, Commons, etc.</p>

<p>To Article V. he advised that, whereas new money
had been made in Flanders and in Scotland, proclamation
be made that all manner of coins of Flanders,
Scotland, and of all other places beyond the seas,<!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
should be no longer current in England, and that no
one should receive them in payment except as bullion
to be carried to the King's Mint.</p>

<p>Lincoln, a goldsmith, gave his opinion similarly
against the permission to export gold and silver, and
proposed that the gold noble should remain of the
same weight as it had been, but at a greater value.</p>

<p>To the First Article Cranten said, that no more in
value of foreign merchandise should be consumed
within the realm than should be exported of commodities,
the growth of England; and then, whether the
money were enhanced or debased, it would hereafter
remain within the realm. Also, that exchanges or
other payments by letters should not be made out of
Flanders, or other parts beyond the seas, to pay in
England for any merchandise.</p>

<p>John Hoo advised a proclamation against the
carrying out of gold or silver, and that the money
should be received by weight.</p>

<p>The statement of opinion of the succeeding and
last witness is extremely valuable and interesting.
Richard Aylesbury opined that, provided the merchandise
exported from England was properly regulated,&mdash;that
is, if no more of foreign commodities
were allowed to be imported than the value of the
native products which should be taken out,&mdash;the
money then in England would remain, and great
plenty would come from beyond the seas.</p>

<p>He also conceived it to be expedient that the
Pope's collector [of Peter's Pence] should be an<!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Englishman, and that the Pope's money should be
sent to him in merchandise and not in coin, and that
the journeys of clerks should be entirely forbidden, on
pain, etc.</p>

<p>For the feebleness of the gold, which was occasioned
by clipping, he conceived there was no other
remedy but that it should be universally weighed by
those who received it, and that the proclamation
should be made accordingly.</p>

<p><i>The agreement of the gold with the silver he
believed could not be effected unless the money were
changed, but that he dared not to propose on account of
the general damage which would ensue.</i></p>

<p>On account of the new money which had been
made in Flanders and Scotland, he advised that all
Scottish monies should be forbidden by proclamation,
and also all other monies from beyond the sea, so that
they should have no currency in England; and that
no one should take them in payment, except at their
value as bullion and for the King's coinage; that no
one should export gold or silver, according to the
statute in that case made, etc.</p>

<p>And, further, he suggested, by way of information,
that the pound of gold which was there made
into the sum of 45 nobles (but which pound, by
reason of clipping and otherwise impairing, was
then valued at 41 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> nobles) should be made into 48
nobles, to be current at the same value as before.</p>

<p>This last proposition would have reduced the
ratio to a fraction over 11:1&mdash;something higher<!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
than the ratio prevalent in France. Instead of
acting on evidence such as this, however, and so
changing the ratio, Richard's Government contented
itself with the perfectly useless prohibition of export
of gold or silver (statute 5 Rich. <span class="smcap">II.</span> cap. 1). Four
years later, accordingly, the matter was again pressed
upon the attention of Parliament, and even by the
Chancellor of the realm, Michael de la Pole himself,
in his opening speech. The English money, he
said, was in greater estimation and of higher value in
all other places than in England. It was therefore
sought out and craftily withdrawn, and the chief or
greatest remedy was to increase the value or price of
the said money.</p>

<p>In spite of such recommendation as this the
measure was not adopted, and Richard fell back on
his previous expedients, crying down by proclamation
the value of the Scotch coins, 1387, and of the
gold coins of Flanders and Brabant, 1393, and
ordaining by enactment that exporters of goods
should bring in 1 oz. of gold for every sack of wool
which they sold.</p>

<p>Such an ordinance as this last is of the commonest
and most frequent occurrence in the enactments of
fifteenth-century England, but always unworkable as
warring against the most elementary principles of
international trade.</p>

<p>On his accession, therefore, Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span> found
himself heir to an accumulation of monetary evil,
through the impolicy and want of courage of Richard.<!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE RECOINAGE OF 1414</i></div>

<p>He was obliged, at the request of the mayors and
merchants of the staple of Calais, to abolish the last
unworkable ordinance just referred to, and attempted
at the same time to provide a positive remedy by
reviving a proclamation against the currency of silver
halfpennies brought from Venice, of which three or
four only were equal to one sterling in value. In
1401 the Commons complained in Parliament that
nobles of Flanders were so common in England that
a man could not receive a sum of 100 shillings
without taking three or four such nobles, each of
them more feeble than the English noble by two-pence.</p>

<p>A statute was accordingly passed, enacting that all
money of gold and silver of the coin of Flanders and
all other lands, and of Scotland, should be voided out
of the land, or put to coin to the bullion.</p>

<p>It was all in vain. Two years later, 1403, the
Commons again complained of the depletion of gold,
and again a statute was passed, and so on. This
futile process actually reproduces itself yearly up to
1411, when at last the question of a recoinage was
fairly faced. By the ordinance for, and regulation of,
the money of the realm, of that year, it was provided
that, "because of the great scarcity of money at the
time," the Master of the Mint should make of every
pound of gold 50 nobles, and of silver 30 shillings of
esterlings of old alloy.</p>

<p>This recoinage was carried out and finished in
the third year of Henry <span class="smcap">V.</span>, 1414. Under it the<!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
contents of the silver penny sank from 18 to 15 grs.,
and of the gold noble from 120 to 108 grs., the
consequent change in the ratio being from 11.15,
which had prevailed since 1353 to 10.33.</p>

<p>At this latter rate the monetary system of England
remained for almost fifty years, viz. up to 1460.
But, though the rate endured so long, it is not for
a moment to be supposed that the ensuing period was
one of repose. Within eight years of the accomplishment
of the reform in the English coinage, the ratio
in France was lowered to a point somewhat below the
established rate in England, and with considerable
variation remained lower through all the years in
question, 1414-1460. In 1421 it was changed to
10.29, in 1427 to 9, in 1432 to 10.87, and in 1447
to 11.44.</p>

<p>The effect on England, as recorded in the complaints
in Parliament, was almost parallel with that in
the days of Richard. In 1414 complaints were made
against the circulation of galley halfpence by the
merchants of Venice. Three years later proclamation
was made against the circulation of the gold
monies of Flanders, called <i>Burgundy nobles</i>, which
were of less value than the English nobles. In 1419
it was found that money was being exported "more
largely, and in many other manners, than had been
accustomed, to the great mischief and impoverishment
of the whole realm." And in the following
year the usual statute was enacted, on the petition
of the Commons, commanding foreign money to<!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
be taken as bullion. Again, two years later, 1422,
the enfeebled and depreciated state of the coinage
was so apparent that the collectors of the subsidy
granted in that year by Parliament were instructed
to accept nobles as of the denominational value of
6s. 8d. (<i>i.e.</i> the full value), "provided they stretched
verily to the value of 5s. 8d. by weight." At
the same time silver money was so scarce that
"though [<i>i.e.</i> even if] a noble were so good of gold
and weight as 6s. 8d., yet men could get no white
money for it." In 1423 the Commons complained of
the want of silver coins in the realm, "to the great
unease and harm of the poorer people of this land,"
"because [says the statute, which was accordingly
enacted], that silver is bought and sold uncoined at
32s. the pound of Troy, whereas the same pound is
no more of value at the coin than 32s., with an
abatement of 12 dens. for the coinage."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE MONETARY TROUBLES OF HENRY VI</i></div>

<p>From the twenty-fourth chapter of the statute of
1429 it appears, quite consonantly, "that the merchant
aliens had of late introduced a custom of
refusing to take silver, as they were wont, for their
merchandises, and of taking only gold nobles, half-nobles,
and farthings, which, from time to time, they
carried out of the realm into other foreign countries,
where they were changed to their increase and forged
into other coins, so that they gained in the alloy of
every noble twenty pence, against the tenor of the
statutes, etc., and to the prejudice of the King and
realm. Therefore the King, willing to provide a<!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
remedy, ordained that no merchant alien should
constrain nor bind any of his liege people by promise
covenant or liege, to make him payment in gold for
any manner of debt due to him, nor refuse to receive
payment in silver for any manner of such duty or
debt, upon the pain of the double value of the same."</p>

<p>In 1439 provision was again ordered to prevent
exportation of money by merchant aliens. It was
renewed in 1448, and five years later the Commons
petitioned that the silver mines of Devon and Cornwall,
which had not been worked for a long time,
might be again opened, on account of the great
scarcity of money.</p>

<p>The confusion of the Wars of the Roses, however,
renders it slightly problematical how far the two
successive lowerings of the coinage, which took place
in 1460 and 1465 or 1470, are to be attributed to
arbitrary action or to a natural process. By the recoinage
of 1460 the noble was increased in weight
from 108 grs. to 120 grs., and the value from 6s. 8d.
to 8s. 4d., being a real appreciation of the grain of
gold from .7407 to .7500 of a penny. At approximately
the same date, 1464, the weight of the silver
penny was lowered from 15 to 12 grs. In the
succeeding recoinage of 1465 and 1470 these rates
were again altered. A new gold coin, the <i>angel</i>, was
instituted, weighing 80 grs., and valued at 6s. 8d.,
while the weight of the silver penny was left unaltered.
The ratio was accordingly changed to 11.15.</p>

<p>This was the last change of the coinage made in<!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
England before the era of the discovery of America.
The internal effects which the changes had on the
commerce of the time are hidden from us by the
disturbing influences of the Wars of the Roses.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CONCLUSION OF THE FIRST PERIOD</i></div>

<p>But it is, probably, in connection with this
change of the English ratio&mdash;or with some wider,
general movement, acting on both countries alike&mdash;that
the last monetary ordinances of Louis <span class="smcap">XI.</span> of
France, referred to above, are to be understood.</p>

<p>These acts of conflicting policies mark the conclusion
of the first period of European metallic monetary
history, for no further changes were enacted
previous to the close of the century and the discovery
of America. As far as England was concerned, the
monetary system remained comparatively unchanged
till the days of Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span></p>

<p>On a review of the whole period two simple facts
emerge with unmistakable plainness and import.</p>

<p>1. It was a period in which the commercial
expanse outstripped the reinforcing supply of the
precious metals, and therefore in which a real decline
of prices<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> prevails.</p>

<p>2. The evil effects of such decline were enormously
increased by shortsighted, crafty manipulation of the
currency by the European rulers, and by the rough,
unscientific system of the prevailing coinage and
exchange rates, and by the inability of the age to<!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
understand, or even to perceive, the hidden working
of two metals see-sawing against each other&mdash;acting
as levers against each other&mdash;cutting each other's
throats. The discovery of America corrected the fall
of prices and saved Europe, but it left her rulers as
deadly ignorant as before of the workings of bimetallism&mdash;to
give a name to what they had not even
perceived as a phenomenon, much less as a system.</p>

<h4>From the Discovery of America to the end
of the First Cycle of the Influence of
the Metals of the New World on European
Currencies, 1493-1660</h4>


<p>The last decade of the fifteenth century witnessed
the discovery of America, and therein the monetary
salvation and resurrection of the Old World. The end
of the second quarter of the seventeenth century in
its turn witnessed the end of the first phase, and the
most important, of the New World upon the destinies
of Europe. Practically and historically the century
and a half intervening between 1493 and 1660 may
be treated as a single cycle with a single aspect. It
was a time of unexampled increase in the imports
of the precious metals, of equally unexampled rise
of prices, and at the same time of feverish instability
and want of equilibrium in the monetary
systems of Europe. Two general statements may
be premised.</p>

<p>1. Broadly speaking&mdash;of prices, <i>i.e.</i>&mdash;no movement
of any note is perceptible, or records itself in
legislative enactment until about 1520, so gradual<!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
and at first unimportant was the flow of metal from
America. What did come at first was not silver so
much as gold, and represents the puny and blood-stained
plunder of ornaments from the natives. If
this import tended to turn the balance in any way,
it was in the direction of depreciation of gold as
compared with silver. But during this first quarter
of the sixteenth century, possibly more influence on
the maintaining of equilibrium is to be attributed to
the largely increased home production of silver. The
silver mining in the Saxon Harz, in Bohemia, and
the Tyrol, had received a strong impulse towards
the close of the fifteenth century, while gold was
obtained during the same period in appreciably greater
quantities in the archbishopric of Salzburg, and in
Hungary, as well as from Africa.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GENERAL STATEMENT</i></div>

<p>2. In this second period of European bimetallic
history, the centre of European monetary exchanges
passes from Italy to the Netherlands. Antwerp
takes the place of Venice and Florence. There is a
double and deep significance in the fact. It is not
merely that the trade route had changed in such a
way as to lay the foundation for that development of
European commerce, of which England is the highest
expression in our own days; it is that by the change
was provided a more effective safeguard against
precipitate and overwhelming depreciation. The
centre of European exchanges&mdash;Antwerp in the
sixteenth, as London to-day&mdash;has always performed
one supremest function&mdash;that of regulating the flow<!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
of metals from the New World by means of exporting
the overplus to the East. The drain of silver to
the East, discernible from the very birth of European
commerce, has been the salvation of Europe, and in
providing for it Antwerp acted as the safety-valve
of the sixteenth-century system, as London has
done since. The importance of the change of the
centre of gravity and exchange from Venice to
Antwerp lies therefore in this fact. Under the old
system of overland and limited trade, Venice could
only provide for such puny exchange and flow as
the mediæval system of Europe demanded. She
would have been unable to cope with such a flood of
inflowing metal as the sixteenth century witnessed,
and Europe would have been overwhelmed. But
the foundations of the commerce of the Netherlands
were laid wider. Together with Portugal she opened
an extensive empire along the coasts of Africa and
in the Indian East; and the very time which gave
birth to the revolution in the production of the
precious metals in America saw provision made for
the regulation of its outflow through the commerce
and exchanges of Antwerp to India. In the modern
system this would be a theoretically perfect world-mechanism,
and its working would be normal and
healthy, and the safest indicator of commerce. That
it was not so to seventeenth-century Europe was
simply due to the existence of a disordered, understood
bimetallic system, and the crisis to which
the working of this mechanism brought her has<!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
perhaps not been since equalled at any point of
time.</p>

<p>The underlying causes of this crisis have been
already described. The currencies of the trading
nations of Europe were all unconsciously bimetallic.
Throughout, there was in existence one class who
grasped the <i>fact</i> without any knowledge of the
<i>theory</i>, and profited by it&mdash;the merchant exchangers.
There was constant oscillation&mdash;change of ratio, and
the least alteration of the condition of one metal
made it a lever for operations upon the other. These
operations were arbitrage merely. They had no
relation to the ebb and flow of commerce as modern
arbitrage transactions have. It was a financier's
opportunity of <i>private</i> gain, and for <i>private</i> gain the
system was worked. The ebb and flow of European
currencies, which the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
witnessed, were as unnecessary (<i>i.e.</i> for the
purposes of her commerce) as they were disastrous.</p>

<p>It is sufficient to indicate the tendency of this
argument, and to leave the illustration of it to the
following pages.</p>

<p>The general tendency of the first years of this
period (1493-1520), if discernible at all, seems rather
in favour of silver, and to the depreciation of gold.
The average ratio was 10.75, speaking very generally,
and with every mental reservation as to its applicability
at any particular time and place. An equally
rough average for the preceding time (see <a href="#Page_1">Chapter I.</a>)
would give a ratio of 11.28, showing apparently a
movement in favour of silver owing to the increased
production of gold.</p>

<p>The succeeding quarter of a century, 1521-45,<!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
covers the time from the conquest of Mexico to the
commencement of the exploitation of the silver mines
of Potosi. Looked at from the point of view of prices
in Europe,&mdash;as evidenced most circumstantially in
the <i>Plakkaats</i> of the Netherlands, to which reference
will be immediately made,&mdash;these years display
stability&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> a steady maintaining of the advance
gradually and already made between the years 1493
and 1520, and chronicled for us in the prices of 1521&mdash;rather
than any further great and readily perceptible
rise. For example in brief. In the Flemish
<i>Plakkaats</i> the French crown is quoted at an equivalent
of 1 florin 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> stivers in 1499, and of 1 florin 19
stivers in 1522, when an attempt was made to reduce
it to 1 florin 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> stivers again. From 1522 to 1548
no further advance, but retrogression rather is quoted
thus:&mdash;</p>

invariably illustrated in the tables of Netherland coins
(below).</p>

<p>With regard to the annual average production of
the metal, there is perceptible a slight movement
towards the depreciation of silver or in favour of gold.
This might naturally be expected to express itself in
a somewhat higher ratio. But the differentiation is so
slight as hardly thus to indicate itself, and certainly not
consistently, so far as the ratio is capable of ascertainment.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PERIOD, 1493-1548</i></div>

<p>Broadly speaking, therefore, there is a certain
homogeneity about the first two periods, 1493-1520
and 1520-48, of the new era. These fifty-five years
mark a time of general advance on prices achieved by
1520 and maintained unequally up to 1548, but an
advance which was steadily and almost fairly level on
the two lines of gold and silver, so that the perfectly
well-established advance of prices generally is accompanied
with no great disturbance of the ratio in itself.</p>

<p>In contrast with this all the succeeding periods
have, up to 1660, a distinct character and statistical
bearing. An enormous and ever-increasing advance<!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
in general prices occurs, but it is no longer, as before,
on level lines of the two metals equally. The proportion
of the production of the two metals changes, so
rich was the yield of the silver mines of Potosi. From
being the same with that of gold, the value of silver
produced suddenly rises to three times and then to
four times that of its rival; and at once the ratio
changes, bringing with it all its accompaniment of
feverish instability and flux.</p>

<p>To treat of these countries in detail.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE NETHERLANDS IN SIXTEENTH CENTURY</i></div>


<h5>Netherlands.</h5>

<p>During the period under consideration, the seventeenth
century especially, the monetary history of the
Netherlands supplies the key to that of the surrounding
nations. The history of her monetary exchanges
has yet to be written, and of her Mint ordinances
very little is accessible, as compared, <i>e.g.</i>, with France.
But this is more than compensated by the numerous
"plakkaats" or proclamations of the tariff of coins,
which are to us practical indicators of the rates of
exchange. The Netherlands, as has been already
said, were the centre of European commerce in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, as the Italian
States had been in the fourteenth and fifteenth; and
every change in the precious metals or in the coins
showed itself in the Antwerp Bourse as surely and
swiftly as to-day in London. As prompt to take
knowledge of these changes as Florence had been
two centuries earlier, the authorities tabulated the
various coinages which were current in the Low
Countries,&mdash;and practically that meant the coinage of
commercial Europe,&mdash;tariffed them against their own
by proclamation, and instantly accommodated themselves
to each new change or variation of value by a
new proclamation and a new tariff. These proclamations,
therefore, give us the measure and course of the
monetary movements of the time in fullest and most
welcome details.<!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been already shown that this action of the
government of the Netherlands has a twofold aspect.
From one side it expresses and regulates the natural
flow and ebb of commerce, just as exchange rates
and bullion remittances do to-day. And in this sense
it was perfectly normal, healthy, and sound, more
especially in so far as it provided for the gradual
drawing away overplus metal to the East. But the
Governments of Europe were yet under the spell
of the delusion as to a balance of trade payable in
gold&mdash;that delusion which was, later, dignified in
history by the name of the mercantile theory. Nor
had they yet lost the traces of that mediæval craft
and lawlessness which rose from, and prompted to,
the mere desire of robbing or pilfering their neighbour's
store of precious metal as the first act of self-defence.
Further than this the monetary system
of Europe&mdash;unconsciously bimetallic and with an
appalling variety of ratio prevalent at the same
moment in different places&mdash;lay open, helpless and
defenceless, and inviting to the bullionist, financier,
or arbitragist. In so far as this element of national
greed and dishonesty, or private and unprincipled
gain, entered into the legislative enactments of the
Netherlands, it condemns them as mercenary, and the
monetary straits or tightness, not to say crisis and
panic which ensued, as unnecessary and therefore in
the highest degree lamentable.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SIXTEENTH-CENTURY ARBITRAGE</i></div>

<p>In a blind way the age saw what was going on
behind the financier's screen, however little it under<!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>stood
the theory of it. In many a sixteenth-century
document, preserved among the State papers in the
Record Office at London, abuse is piled on the
Netherlands for their practices in enticing away the
coin of the realm. One of the correspondents of the
Privy Council in the days of Elizabeth, 1575, writes
thus from the Netherlands: "The Low Country
merchants return great stores of money hither by
exchanges, and by the proceeds, as the exchange may
serve for their purposes, they send away her majesty's
coin and bullion into the Low Countries in great
quantities, and the rather by reason of the Hollanders
trading with the East, by which means the realm will
be secretly robbed, if it be not prevented." Twenty
years later the whole subject was again gone into, for
the fiftieth time, for the advice of the English Privy
Council, and it was shown how "foreign exchangers
contrived, by arranging a rise or fall in particular
monies, to undervalue English monies, and draw them
out of the kingdom. Prevention has been vainly
attempted by Acts of Parliament, by sending over Sir
Thomas Gresham to the Low Countries to complain,
and by establishing the office of exchanger, which was
discontinued as injurious to the State. A bank was
proposed, but the Queen had not to spare the £100,000
needed to start it. It is now proposed to settle the
exchange at 10 or 12 per cent., to be fixed yearly,
according to the state of affairs, 20 per cent. or more
being sometimes paid now."</p>

<p>The <i>naïveté</i> and helplessness of the suggestions<!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
contained in these concluding words need not blind
us to the real and pressing gravity of the monetary
situation to which they relate, and which periodically
beset each and every European Government throughout
the centuries under consideration.</p>

<p>Such, therefore, is the aspect of these monetary
ordinances or plakkaats of the Netherlands in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p>To speak of them in detail.</p>

<p>The first of the Low Country proclamations, containing
an <i>evaluatie</i>, or tariff, is dated 2nd January
1516, and it marks the commencement of the influence
of the American discoveries. (See table below.)
By the succeeding proclamation of 4th February
1520, golden reals were substituted for the golden
florin. Its provisions remained nominally in force
for twenty years or so, but almost immediately
the movement towards higher prices made itself
felt, and it was in consequence of this, and after
fruitless negotiations with the merchants of Antwerp,
that Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> issued a series of four closely
consecutive proclamations (1521, March 1522, 19th
June 1524, 25th November 1525). The first three
concern gold, the last only bears witness to the
rise of silver by attempting to check it and call it
down. Similarly, in his ordinance of 10th December
1526, he enacted that the price ruling on the 4th
February 1520 should be again used, and should be
reached at two drops or intervals, so as to create the
less disturbance between debtor and creditor. The<!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
ordinance proved fruitless, and was twice renewed, in
1531 and 1539. In spite of them all, the rise in prices
against which the authorities tried to fight, continued
and had to be recognised. By the ordinance of 11th
July 1548 a higher limit of values was permitted.
Then, for a dozen years or so, attempts were made, by
the proclamations of 23rd March 1552 and 24th October
1559, to make those prices of 1548 the basis, and
to compel a return to it in the future, while recognising
temporarily the higher prices ruling at the moment.
And so the process repeats itself continually&mdash;a
further rise of prices, complaints of the disorder in
the currency and exchanges, and a new <i>evaluatie</i>
issued, regulating the exchanges at the higher rate
for the moment, and providing for the reduction of
prices to previous limits, from and after such and
such a date.</p>

<p class="inline">
In the accompanying table wherever two figures
are coupled together thus,&nbsp;

<span class="inline">
2&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>
1&nbsp;19
</span>
<span class="inline bracket2">
}
</span>

the higher figure
represents the price ruling at the date of the ordinance,
the lower figure is the price to which return was
to be made from and after some date fixed thereby.
A simple glance at the tables will show how futile
and foredoomed was every such attempt to rule and
compel the exchanges. For the explanation of these
tables it will be sufficient to give the dates of the
Netherlands ordinances, premising that up to 1586 the
series was applicable to the whole Netherlands, but
that from that date there is a separate series for the<!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Seven United Provinces, and for the Spanish Netherlands.</p>


<h5>Netherlands Plakkaats.</h5>

<div class="hanging"><p>27th July 1572.</p>

<p>7th February 1573.</p>

<p>22nd June 1574 (countenances the rise of prices over
those of 1572 only until the end of the year).</p>

<p>3rd December 1575.</p>

<p>19th April 1576 (for Holland and Zealand, and to
continue for only six months, when, by the
ordinance of 25th October of the same year, a
considerably lower limit was prescribed).</p>

<p>1579. In this year no less than four plakkaats were
issued, with the object of enforcing a reduction
of prices, but in vain, and the last of the four,
issued on the 19th December, was obliged to
recognise some portion of the rise of prices
which it was attempted to counteract.</p>

<p>9th October 1581. In less than a year the effect
of the strenuous attempt in 1579 had been
completely swept away, and a further advance
had to be recognised.</p>

<p>From 1586 the series of proclamations divides into
two, as has been said, owing to the revolt and
establishment of the United Netherlands.</p>

<p>The one set, relating to the Spanish Netherlands,
includes proclamations of</p>

<p>30th April 1590, again recognising provisionally a
further advance, and renewed on<!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>15th December 1593,</p>

<p>21st October 1594,</p>

<p>16th November 1599,</p>

<p>23rd June 1602 (with some slight alterations),</p>

<p>30th December 1605, attempting to restrain a farther
advance,</p>

<p>30th June 1607,</p>

<p>13th May 1609,</p>

<p>30th September 1610,</p>

<p>22nd March 1611, again recognising the inevitable
advance.</p></div>

<div class="hanging"><p>The last named remained in force until 21st May
1618, with the exception of not being applicable
in Volkenburg, Dalen, and Limburg,
where the abnormal height to which monies
had risen necessitated a special ordinance (4th
March 1616), lowering the price to the limit
of 22nd March 1611, by five separate three-monthly
steps or intervals.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PLAKKAATS OF THE UNITED PROVINCES</i></div>

<p>The second and separate series of monetary ordinances
issuing from their High Mightinesses, the States-General
of the United Provinces, is remarkably
parallel to the above. It begins with the ordinance
of 2nd September 1594: "In view of the rising price
of gold and silver," it says, a "lessening of that price
to the limit of 1586 is ordered at three intervals,
15th September 1594, 10th November, 10th January
1595."</p>

<p>Like the contemporary enactment of the Spanish
Netherlands, it proved ineffectual, and a further rise<!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
had to be recognised in the ordinance of 2nd March
1596, and again of 2nd April 1603. The preambles
of these ordinances, which are preserved in the
huge collections of Can and Scheltus, generally
recite their purpose of providing against the disorders
in the coinage, caused by the daily rise in
price, by the greed and licence of the times, and by
the inrush of the silver coins of other states. Such is
specially the tenor of that of 21st March 1606, one
of the most famous of these ordinances. Two years
later an attempt was made to reduce prices to the
limit of 1606. It proved ineffectual, and by the proclamations
of 1st July 1610, 26th September 1615, and
13th February 1619, further advances were recorded.
By the last-named, renewed on 5th June 1621, an
attempt was made to re-establish the prices of 1610.</p>

<p>So much for the ordinances themselves. It is only
necessary to add, for their general elucidation, that they
generally contain and prescribe in detail the value of
each separate coin circulating in the Low Countries at
the particular time, coupled with an engraving of the
coin, as an assistance to the people in recognising
them. Indeed, some of the ordinances, that of 1606
for instance, contain engravings of upwards of 1000
different pieces&mdash;a significant witness to the international
welter of coins in the Netherlands exchange.
Dissected in detail, with regard to only a few of these
coins, the tabular result is as follows:<!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<h5>France.</h5>

<p>In France the result of the American influx of
metals did not make itself felt until the time of
Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> During his reign the value of the mark of
gold increased 33 livres 4 sols. 2 dens., and that of
silver 1 livre 10 sols.</p>

<p>The main reduction took place at two periods,
1519 and 1540, and with a consequent change in the<!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
ratio slightly in favour of silver. The earliest find in
America was gold, and at first this metal shows a
tendency to depreciate. Concurrently silver, as the
overvalued metal, commenced to disappear from
circulation. It was to prevent this export that in
1519 the <i>écu au soleil</i> was advanced to 40 sols.,
and again in 1532 to 45 sols.&mdash;an advance of 12 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> per
cent. The silver <i>testoon</i> was advanced at the same
time from 10 sols. to 10 sols. 6 dens., an advance of
5 per cent. Even so equilibrium was not produced,
and disorders in the currency continued, along with
the prevalence of lower-rated coins. The town of
Marseilles complained of it in a petition to the King
(8th May 1539), and the important edict of Blois,
1540, which left the <i>écus au soleil</i> untouched at
45 sols., while advancing the <i>testoon</i> to 10 sols.
8 dens., was professedly and purposely issued "to
more equalise the silver with the value of the
gold, and consequently to make the value of our
monies, both red and white, corresponding." Two
years later the States-General when they met
complained of the lack of currency, and demanded
the opening of the Mint at Aix. The request was
granted, but without visible result.</p>

<p>The same process of advance, unequally maintained,
continued under Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span> and Charles <span class="smcap">IX.</span>
(see <a href="#Page_85">accompanying tables</a>).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRANCE: THE MINT INQUIRY OF 1575</i></div>

<p>In the case of the latter monarch it is expressly
stated that the change, which was effected in 1573,
when the ratio was established at 11.77, had been
preceded by a period during which "the people" had
of themselves augmented the value of the <i>écu d'or</i>
to 54 sols. At this limit the Government was obliged
to fix it, but by the year 1577 it had risen successively
to 58, 60, and 65 sols. The evil, as it was thought to
be, of the advance of the monies was attributed to the
caprice and unscrupulousness of "the people," and
the King called several councils of experts to discuss
the matter. Still the process continued unabated,
and on the 19th December 1575, Henry III.
assembled the States-General. The <i>cour des monnaies</i>&mdash;the
officials of the Mint&mdash;at once approached
him with a petition. Their representation is of
peculiar significance:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In spite of the bad police prevailing, we draw in<!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
times of peace twice as much silver from abroad as
the foreigners draw from us. If the reform we
advocate were adopted we should double this net
gain.... Between us and the Netherlands and
Germany, where we generally trade, there is this
difference, that 6 <i>écus</i>, at the price at which they
are exposed here, only come to 5 in the said places,
which has induced a sudden and enormous dearness
in the merchandise which we export from there, and
besides has caused us a great disorder&mdash;to wit, that
the merchants have transported all our <i>douzains</i> and
other billon money, to save themselves from the loss
they would have had to incur in settling in <i>écus</i> or in
any foreign species of gold or silver on which, at the
price they are current at by the caprice of the people,
there would be a loss in settlement of 15, 20, and 25
per cent.... The cause of the enhancement of
prices proceeds from the malice of several who turn
into bullion the best of your coins in order to fill the
kingdom with others of less goodness, enriching
themselves thus with the blood and misery of the
people....</p>

<p>"The remedy is to lower the rate of the monies.... The
<i>écus</i> ought to come down to 50 sols., but
for the present we would consent to it being put at
60, awaiting a further reduction. The currency of
all foreign coins ought to be prohibited as the chief
cause of these evils. For although by all your
ordinances they have been valued according to the
price of the <i>écu</i>, yet the people have always increased<!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
them more than they have your own monies, so that
the <i>écu</i> at this moment, to be in accordance, ought
to pass for 78 sols. This arises from the craft of the
foreigner, and the only exceptions of importance are
the <i>reals</i> and <i>pistoles</i> of Spain, which are of known
goodness and profit to the melter. They have never
brought us harm, but, on the other hand, they are
being melted down all over France, and at the present
rate the foreigner gets a profit of about 7 livres on
the mark of them, so that we advise prohibition of
their circulation. Finally, we advise to do away with
the old reckoning by livres and sols, and substitute
for it the reckoning by écus."</p>

<p>The States-General, adopting in part the weakest
suggestion of this remarkable paper, fixed the écus at
65 sols. The Mint officials at once represented that
this only increased the evil. Henry accordingly
assembled at Pontoise a conference of experts, and
as the outcome of their deliberations decided on the
adoption of the chief recommendation of the Mint
officials' representation. By his proclamation of 13th
November 1577, the reckoning by livres was
abolished and that of gold <i>écus</i> substituted, values of
under 1 écu or 60 sols. to be settled in divisional
coinage, and circulation of all foreign coins prohibited,
with the exception of Spanish and <span class="correction" title="corrected from 'Portugese'">Portuguese</span> gold
ducats. It was forbidden to constrain payment of
any sum above 100 sols. in billon money, and in sums
below that amount to present more than the third of
the total sum in such billon money.<!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRANCE: FAILURE OF THE REFORM OF 1577</i></div>

<p>This extraordinary and, on the whole, admirably
planned reformation merits so much detail because of
the intense importance of its bearing. It in effect
anticipated the reformation which was only accomplished
in England in our own century. So far as it
was actually put in practice it made France monometallic.
The instinct of the time had found its way
to a comprehension of the evil before it, and of the
remedy. The evil was due to a badly-regulated,
weltering, bimetallic system; the remedy was a monometallic
system. It matters little that such terms
were not in use and that the theory of the matter was
not enunciated. The essential point was that the <i>fact</i>,
the <i>situation</i>, was grasped in practice for a moment,
dimly it may be, yet sufficiently to illustrate the whole
antecedent and succeeding event. As a matter of
fact the ordinance remained practically in great part a
dead letter. That it did so&mdash;that it did not accomplish
its purpose&mdash;has been attributed to the <i>malheur</i>,
the unhappiness, of the time. It was due to no such
thing. It was due to the simple fact that in the
ordinance two quite distinct, and one of them impossible,
reforms were projected. The attempt to tie
down the <i>écu</i> to 60 sols. was foredoomed to failure, and
as the eye of contemporaries was fixed more entirely
on prices rather than on method of tender, the most
significant part of the ordinance passed out of mind;
already by the time of the death of Henry III., "the
people," it is again said, had increased the <i>écu</i> to
64 sols. On the 30th March 1594 a proclamation<!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
was issued to call it down to the value prescribed by
the celebrated declaration of 1577, <span class="correction" title="corrected from 'i.e' (period added)"><i>i.e.</i></span> 60 sols. but,
finding it impossible, the whole system created by
that declaration was abolished (September 1602); the
reckoning by <i>écus</i> was done away with, and the old
system of reckoning by livres returned to; the gold <i>écu</i>
was tariffed at 65 sols., and the circulation of foreign
monies was again permitted. Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span>, in his proclamation
abolishing the almost invulnerable system
established by Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span>, attributes to the attempts at
working that system "the present dearness of everything."
It is almost impossible fully to represent
the unwisdom of this counter-reformation. To the
eye of the then legislator there was only one evil&mdash;the
rising of prices. If levelly effected it was, as
a matter of fact, no evil at all&mdash;far the reverse indeed,
and he did not need to concern himself about it at all.
Besides, it was irresistible. The evil that escaped his
eye, or to which he was blind, was that unceasing
process of flux which was caused by the different
ratios prevailing in different parts of Europe. The
scheme of Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> would have proved effective,
where no other measure or scheme of the time was or
could be, and its abrogation in 1602 by Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span>
removed a bulwark and a barrier, and made way for
catastrophe.</p>

<p>Le Blanc considers that this repeal of the system
established in 1577, itself failed of its purpose, <i>because
the increase of prices still continued</i>. "In the seven
years of peace which followed the ordinance of 1602,<!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the depreciation of the gold <i>écu</i> was as much as it
had been in the preceding sixty-five years of war and
trouble." The simple truth was, that it was much
more likely to increase in time of peace and trade
activity than in time of war. The point to notice was
not at all how much the <i>écu</i> did depreciate, but the
relativity of such its depreciation with that of the
standard currency of other countries, and the
monetary disorder which the inequality of ratio and
of rate of depreciation induced.</p>

<p>Alarmed beyond measure at the evident failure
of his plans, Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span> summoned monetary conferences
of his wisest and best, and they were not
even suspended by his assassination. The complaint
again was, that the permission to circulate foreign
monies had led to the transport of all the good
coinage, to the ruin of commerce and great general
disorder. Assemblies were held all over France in
the trading towns, and the result of the advice of their
delegates was the proclamation of 5th December
1614 (issued early in 1615). By this proclamation
silver monies were left untouched, the tariff of the
gold <i>écu</i> was increased from 65 to 75 sols., and the
value of the mark of gold proportionally increased.
The ratio was thereby altered from 12.01 to 13.90.
It is hardly too much to say that this step and
alteration in the ratio saved France from the
catastrophe which befell England and Germany in
1622 and 1623. The arrangement established in
1615 endured unaltered until 1636, when a slight<!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
reduction in the ratio was made to 13.61 (on the
8th May). Two months later it was found that so
serious an export of good coinage was ensuing that
"our kingdom would be entirely stripped of good
currency, to our great damage, etc." A proclamation
was accordingly issued (28th June 1636) attempting
to regulate the course of exchange. The effort was
vain, and on the following 22nd September the ratio
was suddenly and violently altered to 15.36.<a name="FNanchor_10_13" id="FNanchor_10_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_13" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRANCE: THE REFORM OF 1640</i></div>

<p>A glance at the ratio prevalent in other countries
will show how masterful was this act of France, but
it carried with it the seeds of its own punishment.
Such is the nature of the bimetallic law that any
overshooting of the ratio, on no matter which side,&mdash;in
favour of silver or in favour of gold,&mdash;establishes a
differentiation, and the differentiation at once gives
to the one metal a fulcrum or lever point&mdash;a purchasing
power&mdash;against the other, and the undervalued
metal, whichever it is, at once tends to disappear.
Four years after this autocratic measure of France, it
was found that her currency was in so depreciated a
state, through exchange, that the only pieces current
were lacking one-third of their full weight.</p>

<p>The recoinage established by her proclamation
of 31st March 1640, which established the new
<i>louis d'or</i>, was intended as a complete and permanent
remedy, and it may reasonably claim the praise of
having effected so much. The alteration of the<!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
ratio established in 1640-41 by this recoinage (from
15.36 to 14.49) was only made after most serious
deliberation. Monetary conferences of experts were
held at Paris; and it was found, after careful assays of
all the monies of the surrounding nations, that the prevailing
ratios (1640-1) were at one and the same time&mdash;</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

</table></div>

<p>It was therefore decided to adopt a higher ratio
than all these, viz. 13.5.<a name="FNanchor_11_14" id="FNanchor_11_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_14" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The history of the few years succeeding this
measure is most instructive. The depreciation of
monies continued, and on the 4th April 1652 a
proclamation was issued, forbidding the currency of
certain old monies of France, and again attempting to
restrain the course of the exchanges; and three years
later, 1655, under pretext that false moneyers were
imitating the <i>louis d'or</i> and the silver <i>écus</i>, the minting
of <i>lis d'argent</i> (lilies of gold and silver) was resolved
upon. "But," says Le Blanc, "everybody
knows that the true motive was the same as when
a little later they resolved on the minting of 4-sol.
pieces. Under the above pretext, the ratio basis of
1641 was broken. Remonstrances were vain until
experience proved their weight, and the minting of<!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the <i>lis d'or</i> had to be discontinued. The pieces
already minted received a value of 7 livres, and to
correspond the <i>louis d'or</i> was increased to 11 livres,
by proclamation 15th March 1656." As silver was
left untouched, the resulting alteration of the ratio
was from 13 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> to 14 <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">7</span>.</p>


<h5>Florence.</h5>

<p>With the advance of Antwerp as the centre of
European exchanges in the fifteenth century, the mercantile
pre-eminence of Florence and Venice decayed,
and their monetary history loses its former prime importance.
But they by no means thereby lose their
interest for us. Instead of profiting as of yore by
every veer in the winds of exchanges, they are at the
mercy of them, as was every other country outside the
charmed circle of the Netherlands. The influence of
the changed conditions in the production of the
precious metals, due to the discovery of America, does
not show itself in Florence before 1531, when (4th
August) the price was by law advanced. Three
years later, 5th March 1534, it was found that the
state was receiving damage from the foreign monies
circulating, and that the only native coin circulating
was in a worn and depreciated state. A recoinage
was accordingly ordered, circulation of all foreign
monies of silver was forbidden, and all payments and
contracts were commanded to be made in gold <i>scudi</i>
of the state. In order to inform the commercial
element, the Mint masters were further ordered to<!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
make trial every fifteen days of the value of any
foreign <i>scudi</i>, and to publish the result.</p>

<p>There is a wonderful simplicity about this enactment.
In order to defend themselves from a flood of
cheap and cheapening silver, the Florentine authorities
adopted a virtual gold monometallism. That the enactment
was not permanently regarded and kept can only
be attributed to the strength of commercial custom,
and to a true perception in the mercantile community
at large of the essential difficulty of the problem and
its remedy. The Florentines were simply obliged to
circulate all coins, gold as well as silver, because such
was the universal custom of mediæval Europe. By
1552 silver foreign monies were again current in
Florence, in such quantities and with such effects on
the native gold currency, that they had to be again
prohibited and banished (by law of 18th May 1552);
renewed three years later (28th February 1555), and
again in 1557 (29th April). Indeed, within the period
here treated of, up to, <i>i.e.</i>, 1660, there is a series of
thirteen or fourteen separate re-enactments of the prohibition
relating to these monies and the depreciated
Florentine billon money ("<i>quattrini neri</i>"). If,
during this period, Florence had occupied the commanding
position that Antwerp did, quite unique
interest would attach to the record of this monetary
policy or experiment. But not being in that position,
and being, too, quite apparently unable to enforce her
own enactments in her own territory, even this merely
depressive policy was partially broken down. In so<!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
far as it was broken down she lay at the mercy of the
monetary changes around her, and of the Netherland
financiers, as did every other country of Europe. By
the law of 5th April 1630, all species of foreign
ducatoons were prohibited, "in consideration that,
within the short time they have been introduced, so
great a quantity, and of such differing standards, has
been imported from the various foreign Mints." Five
years later the gold coin was in so depreciated a state
as to call for legislative interference (9th February
1635, renewed on 5th February 1645); and again in
1661 (3rd February) it was found necessary to
prohibit the circulation of the silver <i>reals</i> of Peru and
every other kind of Spanish silver, except at bullion
value. These are only a few from a long list of
similar enactments, but they serve adequately to show
the trend of events on small as well as large fields of
operations. What an amount of commercial disturbance
and disaster lies behind the dry details of these
legal enactments, the case of England will serve to
show.</p>

<h5>Germany.</h5>

<p>The monetary history of Germany is one of
extreme confusion and intricacy. The lack of
coercive power in the central authority&mdash;in the
Emperor himself&mdash;was as conspicuously displayed in
the monetary ordinances of the empire as in the
political sphere. The imperial edicts were disregarded,
and each separate circle of the empire, or each
separate prince or union of princes, left to shift or act<!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
for themselves. Amid all the confusion of such a disorganised
and reeling system sufficient is perceptible
to indicate the broad tendency of events, and to show
how closely analogous was her experience to that of
Europe generally within the same period.</p>

<p>In Germany, as in the Netherlands, France, and
England, the influence of the discovery of America
only begins to express itself about 1520, and in the
usual way&mdash;influx, movements and disorders in the
currency and ratio, and general complaints. In 1520
a monetary convention was summoned to meet at
Forchheim. This was followed by the debate in the
Reichstag at Nürnberg (1522), where great complaints
were made of the unusable, false, and depreciated
coinage, "due to the stealing away and exchanging
abroad of the gold <i>gulden</i> and silver coins." It was
in consequence of the representations of this Reichstag
that the first of the series of three imperial Mint
ordinances was issued by Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> (at Esslingen,
1524). The main details of this ordinance will be
found in the accompanying tables and in <a href="#Page_360">Appendix V.</a></p>

<p>The effect of the first imperial ordinance was to
change the ratio from something between 10 and 11
to 11.38. The <i>gulden</i> was raised from 17s. 4 pf. to 17s.
6 pf. All foreign gold was to be taken at equivalent
rates, and whoever gave more for foreign coins of gold
was to suffer a heavy penalty. Further, the export of
gold and silver was forbidden, on pain of life and goods.</p>

<p>The ordinance remained a dead letter, and the
monetary disorder of the country only increased.<!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GERMANY: THE THREE IMPERIAL EDICTS</i></div>

<p>In 1530 the Reichstag of Augsburg demanded the
holding of a council, in order to enforce the late edict,
and for a due consideration of the monetary situation.
Several attempts were made with this object, but fruitlessly,
and the princes of the empire fell back on the
only feasible but fatal plan of smaller Mint conventions
between contiguous states. There is an endless series
of these, and they render the history of German
currency a perfect jungle of intricacies. Nine years
later (1539), a monetary convention was summoned to<!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
meet at Augsburg by Ferdinand, heir to the empire.
It proved fruitless. Again, in 1548, after the expiry
of a similar period, the Reichstag at Augsburg declared
for another monetary convention to relieve the disorder.
The opinions of certain deputies to this convention,
which met on the 8th October 1550, were as follows:
"For fifty or even eighty years and more the ratio
between gold and silver has been between 12 and
13. But in a gulden of those days there was an
equivalence of more silver than in seventy-six of our
kreutzers. Since then we apprise the Rhenish gold
gulden and kreutzers less than foreign nations. Therefore
France and England seek them."<a name="FNanchor_12_15" id="FNanchor_12_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_15" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>A thorough inquest into the subject, or evaluation,
was therefore ordered, and it was in accordance
with the advice of the convention and with
the report of the evaluation that the second imperial
Mint edict was issued at Augsburg, 1551. This
edict was drawn up on a ratio of 10.83 as a basis,
and, as might be reasonably expected from the different
ratios ruling abroad at the time, it proved as
inoperative as its predecessor. The succeeding ten
years witnessed a rise in the relative value of gold, or
depreciation in that of silver, and the third and last of
these imperial Mint edicts, that of the Emperor Ferdinand,
issued at Augsburg, 19th August 1559, fixed
a higher ratio, viz. 11.44. The Rhenish <i>gulden</i>
was raised from 72 to 75 kreutzers. The increasing
production of silver indicated by this change is still<!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
more clearly marked in the resumption of the coining
of the imperial thalers, at the instigation of the Reichstag
at Augsburg, 30th May 1566. The advice of
this Reichstag was the outcome of the monetary convention
held at Nördlingen two years earlier, at which
strong complaints were appointed to be made before
the Reichstag of the weak state of the coin, and of its
under-valuation.</p>

<p>In matter of fact, the Mint edict of 1559 remained a
dead letter; nominally, however, it continued in force
up to 1600, although no less than seven attempts were
made at succeeding diets, from 1566 to 1596, to enforce
it and bring it up to date. In the Reichstag of Speyer,
1570, complaints were made of the universal loss arising
from the non-observance of the edict. In place of an
imperial coinage, nothing circulated but foreign and
counterfeit coins, and the necessaries of life had risen
to a prohibitive height. Similar were the complaints
at the succeeding diets at Frankfort, 1571, and at
Regensburg, 12th October 1576, at which last Ferdinand's
edict was again re-enacted, with a command
that the Burgundian circle and the Swiss should conform
themselves to it. Bitter complaints were made
of the bad state of the gold and silver coinage, and of
the enrichment of the exchangers on the Rhine. The
circulation of Dutch and Swiss thalers was forbidden
because of the loss by exchange, and the export of all
gold and silver again forbidden. As an instance of
the depreciation prevalent in the coinage, it was
noted that the silver <i>albus</i> had lost one-third of its<!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
weight, so that thirty-six were needed to purchase
one gold gulden, whereas formerly twenty-six were
equivalent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GERMANY: DISORDERS OF 1580</i></div>

<p>Four years later, 1580, Ferdinand, as Archduke of
Austria, issued a fresh tariff, with the object of checking
exports, and in 1582 the states, having consulted as to
the condition of the coinage, strongly advised a renewal
of the prohibition of the export of coin, especially by
the Italians. This advice was adopted in the Reichstag
of Augsburg, which met seventeen days later,
20th September 1582. The preamble of the Act then
and there passed speaks of the export of a good portion
of the native currency, and of the unmeasured
rise of prices, coupled with the circulation of forbidden
foreign specie, large and small.</p>

<p>This resolution of the Reichstag was followed by
the enacting of the Mint edict of 10th December 1582.
It proved as futile as any of the others; and two years
later, July 1584, the deputies of the three circles of
Franconia, Swabia, and Bavaria complained that within
the four years immediately preceding several millions
had left the country by way of the Rhine provinces
for the Netherlands, very little going to Italy by
comparison.</p>

<p>On this representation another useless edict was
issued by the Emperor Rudolph <span class="smcap">II.</span>, and in the following
year the merchants at Frankfort Fair found themselves
obliged to agree upon a tariff of <i>ducats</i> and
<i>Reichs-thalers</i>. The <i>Philipps-thaler</i> was put at
eighty-two kreutzers, and the <i>Reichs-thaler</i>, which, by<!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the Imperial Mint edict still nominally in force, should
have been at sixty-eight kreutzers, was put at seventy-four.
This arrangement of the merchants established
a ratio between gold and silver of 11.4.</p>

<p>Certain of these same merchants, examined as to
their opinion of the method of the export in January
1586, explained that it went by way of Nürnberg,
and that the arbitrage was attended with 9 or 10 per
cent. profit.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GERMANY: THE KIPPER UND WIPPER ZEIT</i></div>

<p>Nominally, however&mdash;or in theory&mdash;the arrangement
of 1559 continued the unenforced law of the
land up to 1600, underneath all these attempts at revision
and underneath the different regulations of the
various monetary unions of contiguous circles or states.
With the latter date commences that extraordinary
movement of monetary depreciation and panic which
is known as the "<i>Kipper und Wipper</i>" period. In
great part the extraordinary acuteness of the panic
which ensued was due to internal monetary confusion
of Germany, but that internal confusion simply ministered
to the export of all good specie and metal, and
in the end it became simply a money corner. The
movement began by a coining of the lower denominations
of monies on a different and depreciated footing
or basis. The <i>specie</i> thaler began to part company
from the current thaler, and to rise to more than the
24 silver groschen or 36 Marien groschen, to which by
the Mint edict of 1559 it was declared equivalent. By
1618 it had risen to 1 thaler 6 silver groschen (= 48
Marien groschen), by 1620 to 2 current thaler, by<!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
1621 to between 7 and 8 current thaler, while the
ducat had risen to 13 florins 30 kreutzers.</p>

<p>The course of the <i>gold gulden</i> which could be

<p>This table speaks volumes. It marks the acuteness

<p>It was in anticipation of the approaching disorder
that on the 3rd of March 1609 a Mint treaty had
been made between Mecklenburg, Schleswig-Holstein,
Lübeck, and Hamburg, "for protection against
the Mint disorder, which is most disastrous to land
and people, and to take precaution against the
advance of the larger silver specie." Seven years
later, on the 10th January 1616, the merchants and
financiers of Hamburg drew up a petition complaining
that, through the monetary disorder, trade and exchange
was being driven from the city, as within a
short period the exchange with Frankfort had fallen
from 74 kreutzer (=32 schillingen Lübeck) to 62<!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
kreutzer (=32 schillingen Lübeck), and the exchange
with Amsterdam from 46 stivers (=32 schillingen
Lübeck) to 39 stivers. To the Senate's proposal for
the erection of an exchange bank, the merchants
would, however, have nothing to say, considering it
unnecessary and dangerous, and called for the
suppression of the notes which the merchants had
brought into use to facilitate their settlements.</p>

<p>Three years later, however, the Senate declared
more strongly for the establishment of a bank, premising
in the preamble of their resolution that "it is
many ways known and plain how disastrous a disorder
has hitherto been in the currency, both from the
rise of the larger silver species and from the excessive
importation of smaller depreciated specie, whereby
not only private individuals but also common interests,
as churches, hospitals, widows, and orphans are
greatly pinched in their incomes."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GERMANY: HAMBURG IN 1619</i></div>

<p>It was as the outcome of this resolution that the
celebrated Hamburg bank was instituted in 1619, the
later life of which was to become of so much importance
for the monetary and commercial history of
North Germany.</p>

<p>The curious point to observe is the short time&mdash;a
few months merely&mdash;by which the crisis in Germany
preceded that in England, and the analogy of some
of the manifestations, although there were no such
Mint and coinage disorders in England as had aggravated
and in the first place partly induced the movement
in Germany.<!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1623 a great Mint deputation from all the
circles was held, and in accordance with its representations
the new imperial basis was established, which
remained in force until the conclusion of the period of
which we here treat. By that basis the mark of silver
was coined into 9 <i>Reichs thalers</i> 2 <i>groschen</i>. The <i>thaler</i>
was fixed at 90 kreutzers, the gold <i>gulden</i> at 1 florin
44 kreutzers, and the <i>ducat</i> at 2 florins 20 kreutzers.
This disposition remained the Mint law over all the
weary, disastrous period of the Thirty Years' War,
which is practically a blank for the monetary history
of Germany. It is not until 1665&mdash;the opening
of a fresh period&mdash;that complaints of the state of the
lower denominations of the coinage are again heard.
But how far this quiescence is to be attributed to the
economic wisdom of the settlement of 1623, or to the
mute, dumb, inarticulate agony of Germany during that
strife when her commerce, much more even than her
national life, was suspended, is hidden from us in
almost complete darkness.</p>



<h5>Spain.</h5>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SPAIN: FUNCTION IN SEVENTEENTH CENTURY</i></div>
<p>During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
the function of Spain was a very simple one in the
European system. She was the receiver and distributor
of the metallic wealth and finds of the New
World, and accomplished her task perfectly naturally
and efficiently. But it was at the cost of her political
and commercial future and greatness. If Spain had
been a commercially independent nation, growing for<!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
herself and supplying herself with her own manufactures,
the metallic wealth of the New World would
have stayed much longer in her lap, and Europe
would have starved. But she was not. She produced
little, and manufactured less, and the ill-gotten,
blood-stained gain, which flowed to her shores from
America, served only to feed an impractical vanity
and to further unfit the nation for manufacturing and
commercial life. The, to her, disastrous influence of
Spain's shortlived empire endure to-day, for she is
still as unfitted as ever by temperament and natural
training for mercantile life. Such is the penalty her
dower of New World gold and silver brought her.
Finding she could purchase anything and everything
with this gold and silver, she threw herself into her
work of conquest, and let commerce go. Her manufactures
came to her from England and the Netherlands&mdash;countries
she sought to conquer and enslave;
and thither her gold went in exchange, and before
the century was out those countries had risen exulting
over her. But the point to notice is this. Assuming
this distributing function as her own and proper one,
the only condition essential to its proper fulfilment
was the maintaining of an absolutely unimpeachable
coinage. The rapidity with which the precious
metals left her possession was simply due to the fact
that Spain did so maintain her coinage and for a
sufficiently lengthened period. The goodness of her
coins exalted them above the prevailing rates in
France and the Netherlands, and they were eagerly<!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
sought in consequence. The monies that did not, and
could not, normally leave her possession by ordinary
way of trade left her by means of arbitrages working
on the system of bimetallism, which existed unacknowledged.<a name="FNanchor_13_16" id="FNanchor_13_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_16" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
It was this commanding quality
of the Spanish coins that led to the adoption of their
system by France in 1641. That in the case of
Spain we hear no complaints of depletion of coinage
and commercial disturbance resulting therefrom,
such as mark the history of the other countries of
Europe, is simply due to the fact that her stock of
metals was continually being replenished, and that she
had no commerce to be disturbed. The gold and
silver of America came to her in a steady stream
and left her for the Netherlands and elsewhere
in a stream as steady; and so long as that flow
was turned through her dominion, so long as the
main sources of precious metal-mining were American,
and the product a monopoly-possession of Spain, she<!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
stood above, and felt no immediate harm from, the
bimetallic law which insatiably sucked away her
wealth. Until the time came, therefore, when she
lost her monopolist position in this matter the
monetary history of Spain is free from those features
of disturbance, commercial agitation, monetary conferences
and edicts, which are common to the rest of
Europe, and consist merely of a record of Mint
ordinances regulating the fineness of her coins and
slowly adjusting them to the general movements of
the century. Only in the case of the first of these&mdash;the
edict of Juan and Don Carlos, 1537, by which
the standard of <i>coronas</i> and <i>escudos</i> was fixed at
22 quilates, "which is the standard of the greater
escudos of France and Italy"&mdash;has the enactment
any comparative or international bearing.</p>

<p>For sixty-one years after the settlement of 1497
there had been no alteration of the monetary system.
In 1523 the Cortes of Valladolid had petitioned the
King, Charles <span class="smcap">I.</span>, to lower the standard and content of
the gold coin, "so that in weight and value they may
pass equal with the <i>crowns of the sun</i> which are
made in France, so that by these means they will no
longer draw our gold from the kingdom." In its
ignorance this Cortes also demanded that the silver
monies should be reduced and issued on a relatively
depreciated footing. It was a matter of thirteen
years before Charles yielded and adopted the measure
suggested, in the edict of 1537, already referred to,
and it may be safely said that by the time of its<!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
adoption the need for the measure had passed away.
Any disturbance and loss of her stock of precious
metals caused by the general movement which marks
itself in European history about 1519-20, and which
shows itself in Spain in the petition of the Cortes of
1523, was quickly redressed by the inrush of metals
from America. Finding gold and silver come to her
easily, Spain cared little how they went. After the
edict of 1537 there is only one complaint of the
export of coin recorded in the legislative enactments
of the country, viz. in 1552, when it was decided to
alter the alloy of the billon money in order to avoid
its exportation, "as we are given to understand that
its intrinsic value is greater in other countries than
here."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SPAIN: PASSIVE ATTITUDE</i></div>

<p>The Mint edicts of Spain during the years 1500-1660
simply follow in the wake of the general
movements of prices in Europe generally. The
authorities were perfectly passive to the export of the
precious metals, and no attempt was made to
manipulate the ratio in such a way as to arrest the
outflow. The conduct of Philip <span class="smcap">II.</span>, in 1566, in still
further raising the denomination of the gold coins by
one-seventh has the same passive aspect, although it has
been attributed to a mere base desire on the part of
Philip to fill his depleted treasury by a partial
debasement. A comparison of the movements of
metals and prices in France and Spain will show that
the advance was only normal and general, and the
further changes which were made in 1609 and 1612<!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
have this same normal character, and call for no
comment. At the points enumerated it is quite
evident that Spain merely and mechanically followed
the general trend of the precious metals and prices
through the century. There is no expression of
aggrievement, either slight or acute, at the precious
metals leaving her. While every other country
was occupied seriously, sometimes desperately,
with the question of how to guard their stocks of
them, the eyes of the Spanish Government and
the nation's mind were fixed only on conquest
and imperial growth. The cost of her empire was
such that at the accession of Philip <span class="smcap">III.</span>, 1598, the
national debt was over a hundred million ducats, an
absolutely unparalleled sum for the time. When,
therefore, the Spanish Government began the
enormous issues of base billon money which mark the
reign of Philip <span class="smcap">IV.</span>, it is to be looked upon as a
financial, or treasury, or budget expedient, and
totally unconnected with any currency movement,
pure and simple. These issues were so great that, in
1625, the premium on gold and silver, as compared
with billon monies, was fixed at 10 per cent.; in 1636,
at 25 and 28 per cent.; and, in September 1641, at
50 per cent. (See account of Spanish monies,
Appendix III.)</p>

<p>Such base monies always tend to become the only
<i>visible</i> currency of a land. But, save as thereby facilitating
the denudation of Spain's store of precious
metals, this matter of the depreciation of her billon<!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
money has practically little or no relation to the general
movements of the two precious metals which we are
investigating. It has more resemblance to an over-issued
and depreciated paper currency.</p>

<p>Of that ebb and flow, that oscillation and instability
in the metals, which make the study of the other
currency histories of Europe during this period so
instructive an object-lesson of the effect and influence
of a bimetallic law and system, Spain shows not a
trace. She received the metals in a steady stream, and
emitted them in a steady stream. They poured <i>through</i>
her. Her function was that of distributor, and she
performed it. When the time came that her monopoly
of the metals ceased, her remedy against the ruin of a
bimetallic law was removed, and she became as signal
an instance of its malignant operation as any&mdash;France,
England, or Germany. Until that time came she had
her remedy against immediate ruin in her yearly
argosy, with its blood- and toil-stained tribute.</p>

<p>The testimony of these tables is perfectly general.
They establish, roughly speaking, just such an
advance of price as befell the whole of Europe.
They do not witness the oscillation in the coinage,
and the commercial disaster due to the action of
bimetallic law. For the evidence of this latter, however,
there is ample store of material in the State
papers of England throughout the period.</p>

<p>The moment prices began to rise on the Continent
good English gold tended to disappear and flow
away, being replaced by continental coins of lower
contents (or higher denomination). The stress of
this practical diminution of the currency was made all
the greater by the simple fact that the increasing
trade which accompanied such rise of prices demanded
an expanding rather than a contracting currency.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WOLSEY'S ADMINISTRATION OF THE MINT</i></div>

<p>The very year, therefore, 1519, which marks the<!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
commencement of the rise for the Continent generally,
marks the commencement also of agitation in
England with regard to the supply of the precious
metals. There is preserved among the State papers
at the English Record Office a paper of advice from
a German of the name of Herman King to Wolsey,
dating in June 1519, "How to provide bullion from
Germany for this realm with the greatest profit."
He advises contracting for a fixed supply of metal at
a certain price, which he puts down, and adds: "If
Wolsey will appoint a person to receive the money, I
will engage to deliver 2000 or 4000 marks weight
yearly at this price, but it must be secretly, as, if the
purveyor were discovered, he would be in great
danger, and the (German) princes would not suffer
any silver to depart because of their own Mints."</p>

<p>Four years later the effects of the exchange had
made themselves so felt that Henry was obliged
to make a treaty with the Emperor, Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span>,
"for the reformation of old and new money," 1523.
An attempt was made to tie down the chief coins
in exchange&mdash;the gold <i>real</i> of Flanders, the gold
<i>carolus</i> and the <i>double carolus</i> of Spain&mdash;and it
was further agreed (Article <span class="smcap">IV.</span>) that no new money
of Germany, Italy, Spain, France, or elsewhere,
should be given in payment to English merchants,
unless it had a fixed value in sterling money by
consent of both princes.</p>

<p>In December of the following year Wolsey was
meditating sending commissioners to the Low Countries<!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
to require that all monies valued too high should be
reduced to their normal rate, but he was informed by
Knight, resident at Mechlyn, that, "having spoken
with several who hear daily the council's opinion,
they think it is not likely to be done while the war
continues, as the chief merchandise now is finances;
and, besides, as their 'goldes' are highly esteemed in
France, if they lower them they will all be carried
thither."</p>

<p>Any such method of procedure as this of Wolsey's
was bound to be futile, and Henry's Government fell
back on the much wiser plan of altering the
denomination of the coins. On the 24th July 1526, a
commission was issued to Wolsey "for increasing the
sterling value of the coinage to an equality with the
rates of foreign currency." The reciting information
contained in the commission itself is perfectly succinct
and clear in its bearing&mdash;"one pound weight of angel
gold (<i>i.e.</i> 23 carats 3 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> grs. fine) is worth, in current
money, £27; by alloy of  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">11</span> it is worth £29, 6s., of
which 11s. is allowed the Mint master for coining.
In return he gives the merchants 108 crowns of the
rose, at 5s., really worth but 4s. 10 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>d., which makes
£26, 6s. 8d. So that there is a clear gain of 48s. 4d."</p>

<p>The investigations of the commission were followed
by a proclamation on the 22nd August 1526, fixing
an altered tariff of exchange. <i>Crowns of the sun</i>
were put at 4s. 6d., which only four years before had
been at 4s. 4d., while the <i>ducat</i> was raised from
4s. 6d. to 4s. 8d.<!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>Finding the enhancing of the gold and the export
of specie still continue, an inquest was held, on the
30th October 1526, into the fineness and value of the
coins. As a result of the verdict of the jury, a
second proclamation was issued in the same year,
dated November 5th, "to check the exportation of
specie arising from the increased value of currency on
the Continent." The sovereign was put at 22s. 6d.
(having previously been rated at 20s. 6d.), and
other gold coins in proportion. Silver coinage was
to pass at previous rates, but a new issue was
to be made, in which the ounce Troy was to be
coined into 3s. 9d. Finally, foreign <i>ducats</i> were to
be taken as bullion, no rate of exchange being even
fixed.</p>

<p>At the same time Wolsey was attempting to
negotiate for a supply of gold from Antwerp to
replenish the currency. On this subject there exists
a curious letter from his agent in Antwerp, dated
21st November 1526. "These two days," says
Hacket, "I have been trying to agree with the
principal merchants about the exchange, but none
would make any bargain, as you (Wolsey) have
limited me to 4s. 6d. for the <i>ducat</i>, and as a ducat of
such gold as they would be bound to pay would be
worth 4s. 10d. in the Mint. They must receive
either <i>ducats</i>, or a <i>crown of the sun</i> and a <i>groat</i>, for
every ducat, or the same in <i>angellets</i>. The best
thing would be for one or two of their factors to see
you (Wolsey). The gold can be kept at home for<!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
2 or 3 more per cent., for they would be glad to give
that to take it out of the realm."</p>

<p>The new coinage of 1527 was in complete
accordance with the proclamation of the preceding
November. As far as the tariff or absolute exchange
was concerned, it served to redress the balance,
and thus to bring the English coin abreast of the
continental. In the matter of the ratio, however,
hardly any change was made. In the coins of the
old standard (<i>i.e.</i> 23 carats 3 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> grs.) the ratio remained
as before, 1:11 <span class="above">151</span>&#8260;<span class="below">755</span>; in those of the new standard
(<i>i.e.</i> 22 carats) it was raised slightly (to 1:11 <span class="above">59</span>&#8260;<span class="below">220</span>).
Neither in the appointment of the exchange, however,
nor in the matter of the ratio, could the measure be
more than temporarily successful under the conditions.
The necessity remained as constantly as ever to
watch the changing continental tariff, and to accommodate
the English system to it. One State
paper, dating apparently in 1529, thus pictures the
situation at the time:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Disputes in London between English, Italian,
Flemish, and Spanish merchants, as to the exchange,
because of the last edict about gold. The writer
knows of the importation of 100,000 <i>crowns</i> and
£10,000 in gold, which will be exported again unless
care is taken. In Flanders, directly after this
proclamation, gold was publicly put at a higher price
than before&mdash;a noble at 24 <i>groats</i>," and so on. The
writer, therefore, recommends that the searchers at
the various ports should be warned to attend to their<!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
duty and see that no gold was carried away from the
realm.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND AND THE NETHERLANDS IN 1537</i></div>

<p>No recoinage, however, or change in the Mint
rates, occurred for some years, and it must be taken
as <i>primâ facie</i> evidence that the basis of 1527
continued for some years efficient, and witnessed a
steady growth in the circulation, accompanying a
steady expanse of trade and prices. In 1535,
however, complaints were again heard of the conveyance
of coins out of the realm, and on the 15th July
a proclamation was issued against it. This movement
is perfectly well authenticated. On the 10th of May
1537, Hutton, writing from Brussels to Thomas
Cromwell, says: "<i>Gold</i> was formerly carried out of
the realm [<i>i.e.</i> of England] for gain; now great sums
are sent hither [<i>i.e.</i> to the Netherlands] in sterling
groats [<i>i.e.</i> in silver]. This will both diminish the
coin at home [<i>i.e.</i> in England] and injure the sale of
cloth, for here are but three sorts of money current&mdash;<i>crowns
of the sun</i>, sterling <i>groats</i>, and '<i>Riders
Gelderus</i>' coined in Guelderland." On the 6th of
August the same hand writes, again from Brussels:
"Exchange is stopped, and much money like to be
conveyed over [<i>i.e.</i> hither], though all coins should be
called down here.... The act made for money will
stop the [English] trade in kerseys, and great sums
will be conveyed out of the realm [of England to the
Netherlands]."</p>

<p>That the flow-out of gold in 1526 should change
into a flow-out of silver in 1539 was simply due to the<!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
alteration of the continental ratio. The relatively
great depreciation of silver only begins in 1550. Up
to that time the general trend of the two metals
was on level lines, but with occasional traces or
evidence of an appreciation of silver or relative
depreciation of gold. At such a moment the lower-rated,
<i>i.e.</i> cheaper, English silver inevitably tended to
flow out in the very teeth of searchers and legislators.
At almost the same time&mdash;and as showing at once
how international this trade in money or "finances"
was, and how confused, and conflicting the monetary
system of Europe was, with a flow-out in one direction
and a flow-in from another&mdash;the English merchants
at their Calais Fair reported great gain of the precious
metals. "We have very good sale of clothes," writes
a merchant to the King on the 27th August 1538;
"here is great plenty of money, which causes all wares
to be dear. Your subjects will bring back above £3000
sterling in <i>angels</i> and <i>ducats</i>. We seek all the <i>angels</i>
here and give a penny in the piece to have them to
carry home, so that I trust there will be few left here
in a short time."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CURRENCY MEASURES OF 1544</i></div>

<p>The threatened rise of monetary denomination on
the part of the Netherlands was accomplished by their
ordinance of 15th April 1539, and almost immediately
Henry found himself necessitated to change the basis
of his currency from that established in 1527. In
1542 the silver penny was reduced from 10 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> to 10
grains, and shortly after 1544 the angel was advanced
from 7s. 6d. to 8s. The proclamation which enforced<!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the change is dated 16th May 1544. Gold was
raised from 45s. to 48s. the oz., and silver from 3s.
9d. to 4s. In the purchase price of the two metals,
therefore, there was no change in the ratio, but
calculating on the basis of the issue price, <i>i.e.</i> the
pieces issued from the Mint, the alteration of ratio
was from 11 <span class="above">59</span>&#8260;<span class="below">220</span> to 10 <span class="above">10</span>&#8260;<span class="below">23</span>. In the proclamation the
change was attributed to "the enhancement of the
prices of these metals beyond the sea, as well in
Flanders as in France, which would have drawn all
the coins out of the realm if a remedy had not been
applied. And although the customers of the ports of
the kingdom had been ordered to put in execution the
statutes for the conservation of the coins, yet for the
great gain they were still secretly carried abroad."</p>

<p>The coinage measures, therefore, of the year 1544,
when justly considered, do not possess the aspect
which has been generally attributed to them. It is
incorrect to look upon them as the tentative beginning
of that debasement of the coinage which disgraced
the later years of the reign of Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> and
the days of his son Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span> The measures of
1544 were simply acts of justifiable self-defence and
currency safeguard. The real debasement began
two years later, in 1545-46, when, by indenture, the
silver coins (<i>testoons</i>) were reduced from 10 oz. to
4 oz. fine silver, the 2 oz. of alloy in the former case
being increased to 8 oz. in the latter. In 1550 the
content of fine silver in the testoon was further
reduced to 3 oz.<!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>The plan of this history makes it incumbent to
treat questions of debasement as standing apart from
the subject-matter of the book, which is restricted to
the natural and normal ebb and flow of the precious
metals, due to the action of bimetallic law. The
operation of debasing a coinage&mdash;of lowering it,
that is, so far and so arbitrarily as to remove it at
once from the action of natural law of prices ruling
around&mdash;means an arrestation of natural economic
processes and laws, and the events which follow
thereupon stand apart from such laws and ought to
be treated as so separate. In reality, debasements
always favoured the action of this malignant bimetallic
law, and the fact might possibly lead one to
attribute to the normal action of a natural law what
is in three-fourths of it due to arbitrary action of
government.</p>

<p>It would be, therefore, unfair to treat of debasements
in a history of bimetallism.</p>

<p>Given, however, the above standpoint, and mental
reservation of deduction and innuendo, it is permissible
to treat of this debasement as showing <i>how</i> or <i>in what
way</i> a debasement <i>does actually</i> facilitate the malignant
action of bimetallic law.<a name="FNanchor_14_17" id="FNanchor_14_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_17" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Further, the present<!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
instance of debasement is the only one on record
in English currency history, and the testimonies
regarding it are of extreme interest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE TUDOR DEBASEMENT</i></div>

<p>For the purpose of external or foreign trade, a
debasement of currency is fatuous and pernicious.
The coins are estimated at their content of pure
metal, and the international exchange is so rated.
The consequence is an apparent rise of foreign prices
proportioned to the extent of the debasement. This
at once unsettles internal or home trade prices, and
they rise to the same level, but with such inequality
of motion as may happen to follow from friction,
local ignorance, want of communication, or from the
intricacies of trade. The inequality of exchange-coinage
rates which results from this is the bullionist's
or the financier's opportunity, and swiftly and invisibly
the good species&mdash;or any, bad or good, upon which
any differential profit can be had&mdash;disappear from
circulation. The consequence is that the rising prices
which instituted the process are no longer accompanied
by an expanding or increasing volume of currency,
but, on the contrary, with an enormous decrease in
the total of acceptable or efficient currency. Hence
come decay of trade, and ruin of town and country.</p>

<p>This is no paper, <i>a priori</i> argument. It is the
patent unmistakable statement of history and fact.</p>

<p>The staple trade of England in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries was woollen. Coventry was
one of the considerable seats of the industry, and
known as a flourishing and wealthy town. In the<!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
third year of Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span>&mdash;the time when this
debasement of our coinage reached the lowest point&mdash;its
trade was gone, and its population had sunk
to 3000, "whereas within memory there had been
15,000."</p>

<p>In the extraordinary "<i>Dialogue concerning the
common weal of this realm of England</i>," the scene of
which was probably laid in this very decayed town of
Coventry, the advance of prices, and the general
tendency of the above argument, is more than amply
borne out. "I have well experience thereof," says
the "cappe" or hat manufacturer, "for I am fain to
give my journeymen 2d. a day more than I was wont
to do, and yet they say they cannot sufficiently live
thereon. The city which was heretofore well inhabited
and wealthy (as ye know every one of you) is
fallen for lack of occupiers to great desolation and
poverty."</p>

<p>"So the most part of all the towns of England,"
quoth the merchant, "London excepted; and not
only the good towns are decayed sore in their houses,
streets, and other buildings, but also the country in
their highways and bridges; for such poverty reigneth
everywhere that few men have so much to spare as
they may give anything to the reparation of such ways,
bridges, and common easements. There is such a
general dearth of all things as I never knew the like,
not only of things growing within this realm, but also
of all other merchandise that we bye beyond the seas,
as silks, wines, oils, etc. I wot well all these do cost<!-- Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
me more now by the third part well than they did but
seven years ago."</p>

<p>"Such of us," says the knight, "as do abide in the
country still can not with £200 a year keep that
house that we might have done with 200 marks but
sixteen years ago."</p>

<p>The course of the enhancement of foreign prices
is thus argued between the merchant and the doctor.</p>

<p><i>Merchant.</i>&mdash;"We that be merchants pay dearer
for everything that cometh over the sea, even by the
third part well. And because they of beyond the sea
will not receive our money for their wares, as they were
glad in past times to do, we are fain to buy English
wares for them, and that doth cost us dearer by the
third part, yea almost the one-half, dearer than they
did before time, for we pay 8s. for a yard of cloth
that within these ten years we might have bought for
4s. 8d. When we have thus dear bought outlandish
ware, then we have not so good vent of them again as
we have had before time, by reason there be not so
many buyers, for lack of power, though indeed in such
things as we sell we consider the price we bought
them at."</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i>&mdash;"I doubt not if any men have licked
themselves whole [<i>i.e.</i> recovered the loss] you be the
same, for what odds soever there happen to be in
exchange of things, you that be merchants can espy it
anon. <i>Ye lurched some of the coin as soon as ever ye
perceived the price of that to be enhanced. Ye, by and
by perceiving what was to be won thereon beyond<!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the sea, raked all the old coin for the most part in this
realm and found the means to have it carried over, so
as little was left behind within this realm of such old
coin [i.e., good undebased coin], at this day, which in
my opinion is a great cause of this dearth that we
have now of all things.</i>" "Thereby" he adds again,
speaking of this "basing or rather corrupting of
our coin and treasure, we have devised a way
for the strangers, not only to buy our gold and
silver for brass, and not only to exhaust this realm of
treasure, but also to buy our chief commodities in
manner for nothing. <i>It was thought it should have
been a means not only to bring our treasure home, but
to bring much of others, but the experience hath so
plainly declared the contrary, so as it were a very
dullards part to be in doubt thereof,...</i> Do
you not see that our coin is discredited already
among strangers, which evermore desired to serve us
before all other nations at all our needs for the goodness
of our coins; and now they let us have nothing
from them, but only for our commodities, as wool, felt,
tallow, butter, cheese, tin, and lead. And whereas
before time they were wont to bring us for the same
either good gold or silver, or else equally necessary
commodities again, now they send us other trifles as I
spake of before, as glasses, gelly pots, tennis balls,
papers, girdles, brooches, etc.... As I told you
in your ear before, they send us brass for our treasure
of gold and silver, and for our said commodities I
warrant you you see neither gold nor silver brought<!-- Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
over unto us as it was here before used, and no
marvel. To what purpose should they bring silver
or gold hither, where the same is not esteemed.
Therefore I have heard say of a truth, and I believe
it the rather to be true, because it is likely that since
our coin hath been debased and altered, strangers
have counterfeited our coin, and found the means to
have great masses transported hither, and here uttered
it as well for our gold and silver as for our chief
commodity; which thing I report me to you what
inconvenience it may bring the King's highness, and
this realm, if it be suffered, and that in brief time....
And besides this, have you not made proclamations
that our old coin specially of gold, that it
should not be current here above such a price? Is
not that the readiest way to drive away our gold from
us, as everything will go where it is most esteemed?
And therefore our treasure goeth over in ships....
I hear say that in France and Flanders, there
goeth abroad such [brass and billon] coin at these
days, but that doth not exile all other good coin,
but they be current withal, and plenty thereof, howsoever
they use it. <i>Therefore I think it wisdom we
did learn of them how we might use the one and the
other keeping either of them of like rate as they do so,
that they should never desire any of our coin for any
greater value than they be esteemed at with them nor
we theirs for any greater estimate with us than with
them, and then we should be sure to keep our treasure
at a stay.</i> And as for recovering of old treasure that<!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
is already gone, there might be order that some
commodity of ours were so restrained from them that
it should not be sold but for silver or gold, or for the
third-part or half in such coins as is universally
current, and thus chiefly our treasure might be
recovered by the use of means."</p>

<p>When pressed by the knight to show how this
merchandise in coins was actually initiated and worked
the doctor thus replies: "Well, then, when goldsmiths,
merchants, and other skilled persons in metal,
perceived that the one groat is better than the other,
and yet that he shall have as much for the worse groat
as for the better, will not he lap up the better groat
always and turn it to some other use, and put forth the
worse, being like current abroad? <i>Yea, no doubt, even
as they have done of late with the new gold. For they
apperceiving the new coin of gold to be better than the
new coin of silver that was made to counter value it,
picked out all the gold as fast as it came forth of the
Mint and laid that aside for other uses, so that now ye
have but a little more than the old current, and so both
the King's highness is deceived of his treasures, and the
thing intended never the more brought to pass, and all
is because there is no due proportion kept between the
coins, while the one is better than the other in his
degree.</i>"</p>

<p>"But how," asks the knight, "do they do in
France and Flanders, where they have both brass
coin, mixed coin, pure silver, and pure gold current
together?" "I warrant you," is the doctor's reply,<!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
'by keeping of due proportion every metal towards
other, as of brass towards silver 100 to 1, of silver
towards gold 12 to 1. For the proportion of silver
towards gold, I think, cannot be altered by the
authority of any prince, for if it might have been, it
should have been ere this, by some one needy prince
or other within 2000 years."</p>

<p>So much in brief for this depreciation of Henry
<span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, and for this extraordinary dialogue. The
doctor's remedy was a recoinage, such as was later
effected. The extent of the knowledge of economic
laws displayed by this figure throughout the dialogue
is astonishing. The divine was the better merchant,
and if he had lived&mdash;for Miss Lamond's masterly
identification of this character with Latimer hardly
admits of question&mdash;and ruled in later counsels, he
might have shown himself the better legislator.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ELIZABETH'S RECOINAGE</i></div>

<p>The recoinage which he advocated was not
effectually completed till the second year of Elizabeth's
reign, 1559. The basis on which it was then accomplished
was that of a ratio of 11.79, as nearly as
possible that adopted in the same or the following
year, 1560, by France, and slightly higher than that
which was established in Germany by the imperial
edict of 1559. The coincidence in these rates is
remarkable, and it is quite apparent that the action of
Elizabeth dictated that of France, as also that this her
action secured for England a steady supply of the
precious metals during a period in which France was
violently agitated by currency crises.<!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first year of her reign, 1st May, Elizabeth
issued a proclamation against the export of bullion.
This was followed by one in the second year, 27th
September, against the melting of monies, and by two
others, of the 4th October and 23rd December of the
same year, "for the valuation of certain base monies
called <i>testoons</i> ... finding that the ancient good gold
and silver is daily transported," etc. Finally, on the
15th November (3 Eliz.), a proclamation was issued
forbidding the circulation of French <i>crowns</i> and
Flemish or Burgundian <i>crowns</i>. This series of proclamations
is to be regarded as one measure with,
and as fortifying, the recoinage and the new ratio
established. And the efficiency of the system thus
instituted is to be judged by the fact that, with the
exception of two unimportant proclamations of 16th
October (7 Eliz.), and 1st December (8 Eliz.), no further
legislation or Privy Council proclamation was needed
for a matter of fifteen years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ELIZABETH'S FINAL REVISION</i></div>

<p>From 1572-76, however, as has been seen already,
the Netherlands issued a closely consecutive series of
plakkaats which altered the situation for the whole of
Europe, and England, equally with the rest, felt the
drain. Contemporary evidence as to this fact has
been already quoted (p. <a href="#Page_73">73</a>). Accordingly, on the
20th September (18 Eliz.), Elizabeth issued a proclamation
"for the ordering the exchange of monies by
enactment, according to laws of the realm, ... because
of disorders, ... decay of merchandise, ... and
value of monies." Again, in 1582, inquiries were<!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
made respecting the export of gold, and one of the
London aldermen wrote to Secretary Walsingham,
advising the appointment of four skilful merchants as
an advisory body. Finding the drain continue, on
the 12th October (29 Eliz.) the Queen issued a proclamation
"for reforming of the deceits in diminishing the
value of coins of gold current in our dominion, and for
remedying the losses which might grow by receiving
thereof being diminished." According to the express
testimony of this proclamation the gold coins were
<i>exported</i>, <i>diminished</i>, and <i>returned</i>, and it accordingly
enacted that no coins should be taken as current when
beneath such and such a weight, or lacking such and
such a remedy.</p>

<p>For a dozen years or so after this no further complaints
of a gold drainage are heard, but in 1597 they
recommence. "If good provision be not foreseen
the coins of gold and silver of England will flow over
to the Low Countries as fast as they can be coined,"
is the testimony of a document of April in that year,
"for the <i>angel</i> and <i>sovereign</i> of England are current
in Holland and Zealand at 18s. the piece of Flemish
money, and our silver much after the same rate."
And the writer adds: "I see no harm to this realm, if
the French gold coin was permitted to be current for
6s. 2d., the Spanish gold <i>pistole</i> for 6s., and the silver
<i>real of eight</i> for 4s."</p>

<p>It was under the influence of this movement, of
which more complaints exist among the Domestic State
Papers, that the final Elizabethan revision of the Mint<!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
prices of the metals took place. On the 18th March
1600 she issued a proclamation "concerning coin,
plate, and bullion of gold and silver," reciting that
"bullion of gold and silver, etc., for these later years,
have been much more abundantly transported and
conveyed away than in any former times," and commanding
the observance of the statutes against such
transport.</p>

<p>Finding her proclamation mere waste paper, Elizabeth
resorted to the only safe and possible expedient,
a change in the issue rate of the coinage. But for
once her instinct, or the wisdom of her councillors,
failed her. Instead of raising the ratio of gold to
silver, she lowered it from 1:11 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">10</span> to 1:10 <span class="above">5614</span>&#8260;<span class="below">5921</span>.</p>

<p>It is inconceivable that such a blunder should have
been committed at a time when the production of
silver had advanced and was advancing by leaps and
bounds beyond that of gold, and when the currency
of every European country of commercial note was
being accommodated to the depreciation of silver
with unerring instinct. But so it was, and the blunder
only served to accelerate and intensify the catastrophe
under James <span class="smcap">I.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ECONOMICS OF THE PURITAN REVOLUTION</i></div>

<p>In matters of currency history it is impossible to
separate the Tudor from the Stuart period, and this
last and sole blunder of Elizabeth's administration
only serves to show the continuity of principle or
event, and how little of moral censure attaches in this
matter to abused James any more than to lauded
Elizabeth. But it is instructive and curious to note<!-- Page 133 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
that the currency history of England during all the
reign of Elizabeth shows such remarkable quiescence.
From 1558 to the fatal blunder of 1601 there was no
change in her Mint rates. The complaints of exports
of coins, and the evidence of the action of bimetallic
law, appears only at three isolated and widely separated
periods. The inference can only be&mdash;and it
is more than an inference&mdash;that her reign, besides
being a period of currency expansion, was one in
which the ratio existing in England facilitated the
flow of metals from the Continent, and secured the
permanence of that currency expansion. On this
increased basis of currency was built that commercial
and national, yea even literary, growth and expansion,
which have made the Elizabethan age the glory of
our history. Similarly, the unrest and commercial
credit crises under James <span class="smcap">I.</span> and Charles <span class="smcap">I.</span>, which
resulted from the same wide causes and principles,
underlay and played a vitally determining part in the
agitation and revolution-sowing of their reigns, and
that, too, in a manner which has never yet been
appreciated. The uprisal of England, which resulted
in the first dethronement of the Stuarts, was as widely
and vitally based upon economic causes as upon legal
or religious,&mdash;possibly, indeed, much more so, if we
only knew it.</p>

<p>At first James was determined to proceed with the
monies which were being wrought by Elizabeth's
warrant. But on the 11th November, in the first
year of his reign, a new indenture was made for the<!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
coining of a new piece called the Unite, to commemorate
the union of the two crowns of England and
Scotland. While preserving the same value as the
pound sovereign of Elizabeth's issue of 1601 (viz.
20s.), its weight was only 154 <span class="above">26</span>&#8260;<span class="below">31</span> grains, while that of
Elizabeth's was 171 <span class="above">61</span>&#8260;<span class="below">67</span>. In the following year the
angel was reduced from 78 <span class="above">66</span>&#8260;<span class="below">73</span> grains to 71 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">9</span>. The
combined effect was to raise the ratio from 10.90 (as
in 1601) to 12.15. Elizabeth's blunder was thereby
effectually remedied, but it was not before an outcry
had been made about the decay in shipping, and in
the export of English cloth.</p>

<p>Even this higher ratio did not remain permanently,
or for long, effective. In 1607 the transportation of
specie rose to such a height that a proclamation had
to be issued against it, 9th July, and there was again
talk of establishing "a true and perfect way to keep
the money within the kingdom by instituting a
register for all payments made by way of exchange."
Again, two years later (10th August 1609 and 18th
May 1611), the proclamation had to be twice renewed;
no less a person than Sir Francis Bacon drafting the
clause in the first case. The anxiety which the subject
caused to the Privy Council is quite apparent in the
State papers, and much division of opinion prevailed
before the only possible remedy&mdash;a raising of the
denomination of the coinage&mdash;was adopted. Salisbury
was at first adverse to the measure, but set himself
carefully to study the question. The slow working
of his mind is still traceable in the paper of notes he<!-- Page 135 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
drew up for his own guidance. "All the proportions
of bullion ought to be xij for one between the
gold and silver unmixed. Our sterling standard is
wrought with a mixture of 18 dwt. in every lb.
weight, which is 12 oz.; so as every 18 dwt. is
4s. 6d., and therefore that is wanting.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SALISBURY ON CURRENCY</i></div>

<p>"Now, two things are in question, one the inconvenience
of general transportation, the other of the
particular, viz. Scotland. In the general this is the
mischief, that our gold is not so much alloyed as our
silver, and therefore being more worth than silver is
bought and carried away. The particular, of Scotland,
is more notorious, because it is not forbidden....</p>

<p>"The gold ought to be 24 caretts.</p>

<p>"Now oure angell is not so much but neare it,
about 23 caretts 3 grains and  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>.</p>

<p>"4 grains makes a caret. 24 caretts an oz.</p>

<p>"In silver every pound lacks 4s. 6d.</p>

<p>"A pound is 3<sup>li</sup> in tale.</p>

<p>"In 6 angells wch is in tale 3<sup>li</sup>, and in weight one
ounce, there is not such an alloy, for in silver we
want 4s. 6d., and in gold but&mdash;"</p>

<p>The notes end thus imperfectly, but what Salisbury
was toilfully figuring for himself lay ready to
his hand in the opinions of experts and of the officials
of the Mint. Immediately succeeding these broken
notes of his in the State Papers, there exists a series
of documents which he doubtless had under his eye,
and which exposed the situation with a clearness
that was more than convincing. "Statement of the<!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Loss sustained by England in the Exchange of
Coin." ... "Statement by the Officers of the Mint
that the Raising the Value of the English Silver
Coins by making a Pound Troy of Silver worth
£3, 11s. 6d. only equalises the Value of English
Money with those of Foreign Countries, and that to
prevent the Export of Gold its Price must be raised
in Proportion." And so on.</p>

<p>As the result of such representations, and after
ten months of wavering Salisbury gave way, and
on the 22nd November 1611 he consented to the
issuing of a proclamation raising the denominational
value of all gold coins 10 per cent. This proclamation
was issued on the following day, and the ratio
was thereby at a blow raised from 12.15 to 13.32.</p>

<p>Among the many alternative schemes proposed
before the adoption of this measure, had been one for
"raising £500,000 on loan to the King, by coining
brass money to that amount, and compelling their
acceptance in certain proportions by the people, on
promise to repay within seven years in full value
silver." It was fondly asserted that this would
be a "means of preventing the export of coin and
bullion, caused by the rise and value of foreign coin."</p>

<p>Another project brought forward was "for meeting
the increase of value laid upon the coins of the Low
Countries by issuing a copper coinage, corresponding
thereto, and by raising the value of English silver
and gold coins in order to prevent losses of merchants
in foreign trade, etc."<!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND: THE AGITATION OF 1611</i></div>

<p>A year later a third scheme was proposed to
remedy the under-valuation of English monies, "by
the coinage of small silver monies of coarser silver, so
as to raise the value of the larger money in proportion;
the old standard to be observed in payments of rents,
the new in ordinary bargains."</p>

<p>The step actually and finally adopted, however,
by the proclamation of 1611, did not equalise the
exchange for more than a twelvemonth. The rise on
the Continent continued, and the outflow recommenced.
In 1612 the Council took note of the
persons concerned in this trade of transporting, with a
view to proceeding against them, while on their side the
general commercial public, or such of them as did not
share the secret and the gain of bullion-broking,
demanded that the under-valuation of English monies
should be redeemed by further raising the value of
the coins one penny in the shilling. On the 14th
May 1612 a proclamation was issued forbidding
merchants to exceed Mint prices in buying bullion.
A year later (4th July 1613) we are told that the
Privy Council had sat twelve or thirteen hours on the
Sunday, and "have been forced to dismiss the gold
and silver business, and also that of the fishing, as
involving many points in the treaties with Burgundy
and Holland."</p>

<p>The State papers of this year contain quite
numerous references to the subject: "Statement of the
Undervalue set upon English Money in Foreign
Countries, as proved by the last Placard of the Low<!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>

"Suggestions as to the Means of Preventing
Foreign Nations from taking Advantage of the English
in the Exchange of Monies, viz., raising English Coins
in Nominal Value," etc.</p>

<p>On the 23rd March 1615 a further proclamation
was issued against the export of gold and silver coin,
and in the following year the exports of the East
India Company were limited to £6000 in bullion or
specie. The Mint officials proposed a raising of the
denomination, and again the matter was hotly
debated in and out of the Council. But a different
race of men from Raleigh had succeeded, and,
on the 31st December 1618, the Privy Council
determined that "silver shall not be raised in value
at present, and uniformity in the weight of the coin is
to be observed; the melting of gold for braid or
plate forbidden, but further regulations postponed till
the committee for exchanges bring their report."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND: THE MEASURES OF 1619</i></div>

<p>As it happened, owing to the necessity of replenishing
the King's finances, the question had become
complicated, and some of the measures proposed for
staying the coin had a more sinister bearing, as is
apparent in one of the schemes referred to (<i>supra</i>, p.
136), being, in short, cloaked proposals of debasement.
In setting its face against such proposals of debasement
the Council was right, but such proposals had
relation only to the King's finances, and not to the<!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
currency crux, and in delaying the proper tariffing
of the English against the continental coins the
Council did wrong. By 1619 the evil had risen to
so great a height that the Council determined to
act upon its own proclamations. Eighteen merchants
were sentenced in the Star Chamber for exporting
gold (8th December 1619), five being acquitted.
The total of the fines imposed on the sentenced
men reached £140,000, and it was stated that since
the beginning of the reign a matter of £7,000,000 of
gold had been surreptitiously exported. On the 31st
July 1619 proclamation was issued for a new coinage.
The gold <i>angel</i> was reduced in weight from
71 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">9</span> grs. to 64 <span class="above">11</span>&#8260;<span class="below">15</span>, being equivalent to an increase
of an eleventh in its denominational value: and in
January 1620, following the convictions of the merchants
referred to, the Council busily debated "the
erecting an exchange for monies, to prevent the
export of silver by the goldsmiths who have been
the offenders."</p>

<p>All these steps were taken too late, and the
currency crisis which shook Germany ran its full
course, too, in England.</p>

<p>In 1620 there was a great scarcity of silver in the
country, and the trade of the Eastland merchant was
gone&mdash;a scarcity and decay which they attributed "to
the rise of foreign coin, especially that of Poland and
Holland, during the last four years in which the
Hollanders have farmed the King of Poland's Mint."
The export of cloth had sunk to one-third the output<!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
of the previous year. By May 1621 the situation
had become pressing. The secret export of money
still continued, and it was again proposed to register
bills of exchange, and also to make Spanish and
French coins current in the country. In June the
Privy Council issued circulars to the East India,
Turkey, French, Eastland, and Spanish companies,
and the Company of Merchant-Adventurers&mdash;practically
the whole mercantile corporation of London&mdash;desiring
them to choose experienced persons from
each of these companies, to consult upon the best
means of managing the exchange of monies, so as to
encourage the import of silver, and prevent its export.
Their statement on the 17th June was simply that
the export was due to the under-valuation of the
English monies. The Council considered their report
on the following day, and ordered it to be further
considered, "but the Lords think it best for some
agreement to be made with neighbouring states for
a due correspondence in the value of the coins now
used."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND: THE CRISIS OF 1622</i></div>

<p>But while the Lords of the Council talked of
treaties the crisis came. By the end of the year
there was no money in the country, and trade was at
a standstill. In February 1622, Locke informs
Carleton "money is very scarce. In the clothing
counties the poor have assembled in troops of forty
or fifty, and gone to houses of the rich and demanded
meat and money, which has been given through fear.
The Lords ordered the clothiers to keep their people<!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
at work, but as they complained that they cannot sell
their cloth, usurers and monied men though not in
the trade are ordered to buy it." In March the
Justices write from Gloucestershire: "The people
begin to steal, and many are starving; all trades
are decayed; money very scarce." Stocks of cloth
accumulated in the London "halls" or warehouses
of the various districts, and notes of them were
submitted to the Privy Council.</p>

<p>The merchant-adventurers were appealed <span class="correction" title="comma added">to, to</span> buy
up these stocks, but they were unable. The ordinary
taxes of the country could not be levied, or, when
levied, proved only a fraction of the estimated amount,
and invariably the commissioner attributed the deficiency
to the want of money and the general decay
of trade. "Wools and cloth are grown almost valueless,"
write the justices of Somerset, on the 15th
of May 1622, "and the people desperate for want of
work."<!-- Page 142 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>The expectations of outbreaks were great, and in
Nottingham musters were held, and the trained bands
ordered to be ready for instant service, to suppress
riots, if any occurred (July 1622).</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Council was busy conferring with
merchant delegates from every part of the country.
A new proclamation against exporting coin was talked
of (15th June 1622), and a declaration issued (same
day), that the King purposed to establish a Royal Exchange,
to regulate all exchanges.</p>

<p>"Treatises on Exchanges," "Statements of the
Disadvantages of a Low Exchange," and similar documents
crowd the State papers; and on the 28th July
a proclamation was issued ordering nothing to be
worn at funerals but English-made cloth, forbidding
the export of raw wool or yarn, and declaring the
establishing of a Standing Commission on matters of
trade. On the 30th of August the Goldsmiths' Company
returned their answers to the Council's queries
with regard to the comparative weight and value of
Spanish <i>reals</i> and English shillings, and suggested
that the pound of silver should be cut into 65s. instead
of 62s. The officers of the Mint followed up
this advice by confirmatory testimony. "The business
is weighty," wrote Sir Robert Heath to Secretary
Calvert, in enclosing him the above reports. "For
we are drawn dry. Coin must be brought in from
elsewhere [<i>i.e.</i> abroad], which can only be by assurance
of gain to the merchants in equalling our coin to that
of other States." As a corollary it was proposed on<!-- Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the following day, August 31, to encourage the bringing
in of money by making the Spanish <i>real</i> pass
current at 4s. 8d., its true value in English coin.
"The merchants will bring them in at this profit,
though they can gain more for them in Holland, and
they press for an immediate reply, as the Spanish
fleet is coming in, and the money will be brought
hither if the merchant can make a reasonable profit."</p>

<p>In September the clothworkers and dyers of London
complained in a petition of their want of employment,
and that many thousands of them were in the
greatest distress. So great was the want in the
country districts that a proclamation was issued ordering
all persons of quality in London and Westminster to
go to the country, and reside on their estates, for the
relief of the poor in the dearth. In January 1623 fears
of disturbance in Essex were rife, "because of poor
clothworkers, the masters being unable to employ
the men, and many who were thought the wealthiest
were likely to become bankrupt." On the 7th of February
the officers of the Mint reported to the Council
that they found the value of the Spanish <i>real of eight</i>
to be equal to 4s. 6 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>d., as compared with the new
shilling coin; and on the 4th of March following a
proclamation was issued to make these Spanish <i>reals</i>
current at 4s. 6d., "in hopes of bringing some of that
coin to the Mint."</p>

<p>From this time onwards no further references, save
one laconic remark in May 1623, "the poor do not complain
much," occur in the State papers to this, one of<!-- Page 144 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the acutest currency crises in our history; and we
are left to follow the process of recovery and the
dumb, inarticulate agony of the widespread ruin in
sympathy and imagination merely. The details here
given are taken entirely from the State papers, stolid
and ungarnished, but the tale they tell is momentous
and dire in its importance.</p>

<p>When consulted by the Privy Council, the various
committees and delegates of the merchants attributed
the crisis to the deceits practised in the manufacture
of cloth, to the embargo on its sale, and other such
causes, as well as to the scarcity of money, and the
loss in exchange. The first suggestion is hardly worth
a moment's consideration. Every testimony points
to the fact that the crisis was as purely a monetary or
currency crisis, as later crises have been distinguishedly
credit crises. Between 1613 and 1621 hardly any
silver monies were coined in the English Mint; for
example, between 1617 and 1620 the total silver
coinage was only £1070, whereas in the four succeeding
years the silver coinage at the Tower Mint
amounted to £205,500.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND: JAMES I.</i></div>

<p>"From the year 1621," says one of the informers
of 1638, to whose petition reference will be shortly
made, "many goldsmiths and cashiers of London
culled the weighty shillings and sixpences to make
into plate, silver wire, and to other manufactures;
for most of that time, we having wars with Spain,
little or no silver came from thence; so likewise hath
little or no silver from France in that time, and no<!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
silver could be brought out of Holland by reason it
went so high by the placard. For sterling silver
passed in Holland for 4d. per ounce higher than it was
made in our Mint, sterling being in Holland at 5s. 4d.
per ounce, so that no silver could be imported from
Holland to supply our Mint, which the goldsmiths
and others perceiving presently fell a-culling the silver
monies current, and the money being coined in the
Mint at 5s. 2d., the goldsmiths, finers, and wire-drawers
did raise it up to 5s. 3d. per ounce, and melted down
into the weight of shillings and sixpences, and left none
to pass betwixt man and man but light monies and
clipped, and did exceed the rate of the Mint by giving
for sterling 5s. 3d. per ounce, and 5s. 3 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>d., and sometimes
more; by which means there was no silver
brought into the Mint for ten years to speak of but
the silver which came from Wales. This will appear
by the Mint books."</p>

<p>The testimony only confirms the previous inference.
The whole reign of James <span class="smcap">I.</span> was a period of
inefficient attempts to rate the English coinage to the
incessant rise in the continental coinages, of consequent
drain of specie to the Netherlands, and of practical
closing of the Mints at home. The cause, opportunity,
channel, or machinery of the drain was the incessantly
shifting, badly tariffed, imperfectly understood
bimetallic system of the times; and the crisis of 1622
was only the most patent expression of its malignant
action. It is doubtful whether the political effect of
that crisis has been properly estimated by the consti<!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>tutional
student of the popular revolution under the
Stuarts. Its commercial, currency, and economic and
theoretic influence has certainly, and much more, been
hitherto overlooked.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND: CHARLES I.</i></div>

<p>The reign of Charles <span class="smcap">I.</span>, and the period of the
Commonwealth, display similar characteristics to that
of James <span class="smcap">I.</span>, but in a more modified and less malignant
measure. Putting aside, after one nearly fatal slip in
August 1626, the various propositions for a debasement
which were made early in his reign, Charles
made, throughout, no change in the denomination or
value of his coins, and no change in the ratio. In
1627 the export of coinage became again perceptible,
and a warrant was issued for erecting a Royal
Exchange between England and Scotland, September
28, and for a proclamation forbidding all indirect
practices of merchants, and underhand buying of uncurrent
coin and foreign bullion.</p>

<p>In the following March, 1628, a committee was
appointed to advise his Majesty concerning the coins,
and to observe from time to time all accidents at home
and abroad touching coins. Numerous schemes were
proposed for the arresting of the process of export.
They bear generally two characters&mdash;(1) as proposing
a change of the ratio; (2) as proposing a differential
issue of the silver issue coinage, <i>i.e.</i> coining 4d., 3d., and
2d. silver pieces at a different and higher rate than the
larger silver pieces. Such schemes have no importance
at the present day, save as foreshadowing the
mechanism by which England finally evolved a mono<!-- Page 147 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>metallic
system which permitted of the fullest retention
of silver. The flow of coinage which these
proposals were intended to meet was not now to the
Netherlands but to France, and it must be attributed
to the course of the French currency already indicated.
In 1630 the names of certain merchants engaged in
the transport of gold and silver were reported to the
Council, together with the names of the French merchants
who received the same in France. In June
1635 certain of these were arrested, and in 1638 not
less than thirty-seven of them were prosecuted in the
Star Chamber for this unlawful transportation. The
drain went steadily on during the whole of the decade.
On January 18, 1635-6, a proclamation was issued for
restraint of the consumption of coin and bullion. In
the following March an order of the King in Council
was issued against the exportation of English and
Scotch coin, and by gentlemen crossing the sea, and
forbidding the wearing of jewels, etc., "because of
the great quantity of money exported." Any such
enactments were doomed to be futile. The true
remedy, or rather the keynote of the situation, was
contained in a proposition submitted to the Privy
Council for the making current of certain foreign coins.
"The forbidding of Spanish money in England," says
the author Barrett, "was to enrich the Mint, which
brought forth contrary effects, for the French, Dutch,
and other nations, by advancing Spanish coins, received
the greatest profit." He accordingly proposed
that the King should raise the Spanish money to be<!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
current in England by proclamation. The double
<i>pistolets</i> weighing 16s. to be raised to 15s.; the <i>piece
of eight</i> weighing 5s. to be raised to 4s. 6d., "and when
there is store brought into the kingdom, then have a
new proclamation to call in these coins to be stamped
with a mark and apprised to the intrinsic value." The
step was not adopted, and by his Majesty's declaration
of 1639 in the Star Chamber, gold and silver
were to be considered commodities of merchandise.
"By 1640 there was not in the kingdom a million of
silver," says Sir Ralph Maddison in a memorial.
"Gold and silver," said Sir Thomas Roe in his speech
on trade in the Commons, "are very scarce, and
the kingdom is impoverished. Money has been
drawn away into other kingdoms, especially into
France and Holland, where it is worth more." One
of the informants, who had been employed by the
Government in the prosecutions of 1638, thus gave
his testimony in a petition which he subsequently
drew up: "Divers goldsmiths of London are become
exchangers of bullion of gold and silver, and
buy it of merchants and others, pretending to carry
it to the Mint. But indeed they are the greatest
instruments for transporting that are, and in a manner
they are only those who furnish transporters with
English and foreign gold, Spanish money, <i>rixdollars</i>,
<i>pistolets</i>, <i>cardacues</i>, etc. Some of the goldsmiths
make it their use and practice to buy light English
gold of shopkeepers and others, which, by the laws of
this kingdom, wanting beyond remedy, ought to be<!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
bought as bullion, and upon the sale ought to be
defaced and new-coined in the Mint. But they take
another way, for they sell all this gold to transport,
though it want four, five, or six grains above the
allowance, and that a 20s.-piece will not make 19s. to
be coined in the Mint. Yet the goldsmiths will not
abate above 2d. or 3d., and sometimes but 1d. in
the piece, let the gold want what it will, by which
means they outgive the Mint, and the gold which
the goldsmiths buy of the subjects, thinking it is to
carry to the Mint to be new-coined, to pass in current
payment, they put it into a dead sea, never to be
made coin of in our commonwealth. For, weekly,
French and English have bought up this gold, let it
be as light as it will, at 19s. 9d., 19s. 10d., 19s. 11d.,
and so after that rate for all other gold, to the value of
many hundred thousand pounds. Many thousands of
<i>dollars</i> and Spanish money they furnish yearly to
merchants that trade for Norway and Denmark, to
transport silver for those parts."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND: THE SITUATION IN 1638</i></div>

<p>The drain of coinage to France he distinctly
attributes to the raising of the French coins. "At
this present in France the native merchants there
match us with such a point of policy that it would be
hard for our merchants to be master of.... Since the
raising of our 20s.-piece to 26s. there ... they have
advanced the price of their commodities according to
their advanced monies, to the full sum of 6s. in the
pound more than they were before."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND: SIR ROBERT STONE ON THE MINT</i></div>

<p>During the Civil Wars there is a remarkable<!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
paucity of reference to the subject, doubtless owing
to the supreme importance of the war itself. On the
26th August 1643, and on the 24th February 1643-4,
the Long Parliament issued orders, on the petition of
merchant strangers who were prevented from importing
bullion by the rigours of the search of their vessels,
for their due encouragement. The petitions would
argue a tendency towards an importation of specie, but
in 1649 this was again changed, and a heavy export
became perceptible. There can be little doubt that
the initial impulse came from the new coinage which
was instituted by the Act of 17th July 1649, and by the
table of weights for the Commonwealth coins which
that Act adopted. For two years and more both
Council and Parliament were exercised in mind with
regard to this export of specie and the consequent
decay of trade, and draft Acts to prevent the export, as
well as many other propositions, were had under long
consideration. No measures were adopted, and an
Amsterdam correspondent of Sir Robert Stone, in May
1652, thus gave his opinion of the wisdom of the Mint
officials and the Government in this process of drift:
"Experience has taught me that when the State does
not keep extraordinary watch, and the laws are not
put into execution against culling and sorting out the
heaviest coins to be transported, and the light and
clipped left behind, it is a great debasing of the current
value of coin. All your silver money (<i>i.e.</i> in
England) is thus abused by goldsmiths and others.
And when the State does not employ such as can<!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
discover those offenders, but puts persons into the
Mint who have had no experience, great damage
must follow. For there are bankers and exchangers
in Holland who know the ignorance of all your
present Mint men that have any place of trust, and
laugh at them. They say when the Mint in the
Tower flourished, old Andrew Palmer, Mr. Rogers,
and one Cojan were there, who were all subtle Mint
men, and held correspondence here (<i>i.e.</i> in Amsterdam),
and knew what to do to advance the Mint,
and would always find a way to bring grist to the
mill. But now your Mint comes to be neglected
and money adulterated. Many of our bankers here
have a great trade with your goldsmiths and merchants
in London for English gold and heavy English
silver. Your Mint will never go until this be
discovered, for these men are the sluices that drain
all your money. I believe there is at this day forty
times more gold and silver in the Low Countries than
in England. About twelve years since the French
were forced to call in all their money, it being so
clipped that their commerce ran into confusion, and
you have almost brought yourself to the same point,
the coin in Ireland being 20 per cent. less value since
the war. In England almost all your gold is transported,
and the little that is left is in hucksters' hands,
that go to an exchange in Lombard Street, and you
must pay from £6 to £10, and sometimes more, to
have £100 in gold for silver. For who will take gold
to the Tower to be coined, and lose 2s. in 20s. of what<!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
they can make by transporting it? We have more
English gold in Amsterdam than you have (in England),
all sent within those twenty years, and great
quantities of English silver have weekly come over in
pinks and Dutch men-of-war for years, to the value of
many hundred thousands of pounds, in return for coin.
I wondered at first how the merchants transported all
the weighty and culled English money into Holland,
until one of the bankers told me. I would have you
inquire it and prevent it, for it is a most pernicious
thing. It is the goldsmiths, especially those in Lombard
Street, which are the greatest merchants, and
London cashiers, and who will receive any man's money
for nothing, and pay it for them the same or next day,
and meantime keep people in their upper rooms to
cull and weigh all they receive, and melt down the
weighty, and transport it to foreign parts, sometimes
without melting, and keep banks for all the principal
coin in Christendom in their shops."</p>

<p>The succeeding years of the Commonwealth saw
little change in the situation. In 1659 and 1660 the
Council was still anxiously debating the question of
the transport of bullion and coin. But this chain of
phenomena refers to the third period in this history,
and are to be treated of in that connection.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CLOSE OF THE SECOND PERIOD: RÉSUMÉ</i></div>

<p>In broadest and hastiest résumé, and this by way
of justification of the length to which this chapter
has been drawn out, the influence of American gold
and silver makes itself perceptible in 1520. For
forty years a level and equal advance in each of the<!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
precious metals and in prices records itself, then the
relative and absolute production of silver increases
enormously over that of gold, and the ratio is disturbed.
The inequality of the rate at which this change
of ratio spreads to successive countries, and is adopted
in their various Mint regulations, is the bullionist's
or exchanger's opportunity, and the disastrous effect
of their activity results in the crisis of 1570 in France,
and 1622 in England and Germany. Properly speaking
there has been no subsequent crisis in European
history fitly comparable with the latter of these. If at
all, there is only one comparison possible, and that is
the currency situation in which the monetary world is
at this moment, or which has come upon it since
1850&mdash;a period of bullion inflation in which silver has,
finally as yet, outweighed gold, to the violent disturbance
of the ratio. But, as will be seen, the other
conditions of the comparison are not reducible to, or
expressible in, similar terms, and so far the legitimate
deduction fails. None the less, the currency history
of Europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
has a vital didactic importance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER   III</h2>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">From the End of the First Cycle of American
Influences to the Present Day, 1660-1894</span></p></blockquote>


<p>Up to the close of the eighteenth century the production
of silver shows a remarkable steadiness and uniformity&mdash;the
decrease on the yield of the Potosi
mines being compensated by the increased output of
Mexican silver. In the condition of the output of
gold, however, there is a perceptible alteration, due
to the increasing imports of that metal from Brazil.
The change in the relative production of the two
metals appears from the table on p. <a href="#Page_155">155</a>.</p>

<p>The effect on the ratio of this increased relative
and absolute amount of gold was, however, considerably
diminished by the increasing favour with which
gold came to be regarded for currency purposes,
from the end of the seventeenth century onwards. In
general terms this process or tendency in favour of
gold continued through the first sixty years of the
eighteenth century, at which time the proportion of
gold to the production of the two metals had risen as
high as 40 per cent., whereas in 1600 it had only
formed 17.2 per cent. of the total.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PRODUCTION OF THE PRECIOUS METALS, 1660-1893</i></div>

<p>From 1760, however, such relative preponderance<!-- Page 155 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
of gold was not maintained. It gradually sank back
until, by the beginning of the present century, it had
come to form only a little over 23 per cent. of the
total. From 1820 to 1840 a recovery took place,
but it was not until the Californian gold discoveries
that the second great disturbance in the relative
production of gold and silver took place; such a
disturbance, <i>i.e.</i>, as can be fitly compared with that
which the sixteenth century witnessed.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_D_18" id="Footnote_D_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_18"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> The figures for the last three years are taken from the Report of the
Hon. R.E. Preston, director of the United States Mint, 1893 (<i>Report on the
Production of the Precious Metals</i>, pp. 274-5). See <i>ibid</i>. for a most carefully
compiled table of the production of the precious metals from 1493 to 1893,
differing from the above in material details.</p></div>

<p><!-- Page 156 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>As far as this <i>relative</i> production is concerned, the
period, 1660-1840, is one of gradual and not abnormal
variation, neither small nor inconsiderable in
effect, but certainly not revolution-working, as had
been the case in the sixteenth century with American
silver, and as was to be in the nineteenth century with
Californian and Australian gold, and in our own days
with American silver for the second time.</p>

<p>With regard to the <i>absolute</i> production&mdash;gold
shows a rise up to 1760, then a steady decline to
1820, followed by a second rise up to 1840. In the
case of silver the decline in the absolute amount was
steady from 1600 to 1680, then ensued a steady and
strong rise to 1800, followed by an abrupt drop in the
second decade of the present century, and then by a
strong and steady recovery, commencing from 1830
and continuing until the present.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WIDE EFFECT OF MINT LAWS</i></div>

<p>The larger question of the relative distribution of
this mass of precious metals depends for its determination
upon a full understanding of the law of
the various Mints. Speaking in large, during the
eighteenth century the Mint ratio was in favour of
silver in France, and her currency was almost entirely
silver throughout the century; conversely the Mints<!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
favoured gold in England and Spain, and gold was
almost the only constituent of the currency of either
country for the greater part of the century. There
can be little doubt that these simple facts had a great
influence in actually determining the great currency
legislation which closed the century and finally
decided England in favour of gold, and France and
the United States in favour of a bimetallism strongly
favouring silver.</p>

<p>As far as the conditions of production of the precious
metals are concerned, and the connection between those
conditions and the ratio, there is historic and understandable
continuity between the period already passed
in review and modern times. In the method of expressing
that ratio, however, there is a remarkable difference.

<div class="sidenote"><i>EVOLUTION OF THE MODERN SYSTEM</i></div>

<p>With the close of the seventeenth century the advantage
of the process of altering the denomination of
the coinage, of diminishing the content and reducing the
standard of fineness, began to be impugned on theoretic
grounds, and in the course of the eighteenth century
that process itself fell into disuse. Since that time
no Mint or legislative change such as we have hitherto
described was made on the expressed value or content
of any European coinage. Bearing in mind the twofold
importance which was attached to that process of
legislative guarding of the currency, this change must
be regarded as of vital import. The legislator, from
the middle of the fourteenth century, had attempted
two things by this mechanism&mdash;(1) to follow the general
rise of prices, and meet it by reducing the contents
of the coins in such proportion as he thought fit; (2) to
prevent any disastrous outflow of the precious metals
by altering the ratio. The control of the Mint rates
of metal-purchase and metal-coinage was, therefore,
a matter of importance financially and politically to the
nation, and economically to international commerce.
In just such measure, therefore, was the entire ceasing
of this State control of the mechanism of international
exchange and currency a matter of almost incalculable
significance in the history of the European monetary
system. In the domain of finance it effected a revolution
as signal as that produced in the relations of
labour to capital by the disuse of the old labour laws.
The ceasing of the artificial arbitrary Mint rates made
way for a naturally determined or <i>commercial</i> ratio,<!-- Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
and the regulation of the international flow of the precious
metals was left to the oscillation of trade balances,
and to the action of interest rates and discount. The
change is one from a mediæval, State-bound, merely
legislative system to the modern system, in which the
flow of precious metals is determined by the perfectly
natural and automatic action of international trade&mdash;is
indeed the index and safety-valve of it, and of the
whole present commercial world-circle.</p>

<p>This was not merely a change of fact and practice,
it was a revolution of theory.</p>

<p>For before the old State belief in the necessity of
safeguarding the supply of precious metals at any
cost and consideration could go by the board, the whole
Mercantile Theory must have lost its force in men's
minds.</p>

<p>In the domain of theory the transition from the
Mercantile to the modern system was gradual, through
the various intermediate steps of Physiocratic and
Smithian economics, and the complete abandonment
of that system for our own can only be put very late,
if indeed its period can at all yet be written, for
modern Protectionist ideas are only a lusty survival
of it. In the domain of financial practice, however,
it&mdash;the mercantile system&mdash;ceased from the moment
that the Governments of Europe left their Mint rates
stationary, and gave the flow of the precious metals and
the declaration of the ratio to the free unhampered
natural action of international trade. The steps of
the completed process can hardly be detailed, for there<!-- Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
was much fear attending it, and the various Governments
frequently retraced their steps in uncertainty.
The earliest direct enactment was made by England.
By the Act of 15 Charles <span class="smcap">II.</span>, chap. 7, sect. 12 (1663),
the statutes forbidding the exportation of bullion were
removed at one blow of astounding boldness. "Forasmuch,"
says this Act, "as several considerable and
advantageous trades cannot be conveniently driven
and carried on without the species of money or bullion,
<i>and that it is found by experience that they are carried
in greatest abundance (as to a common market) to such
places as give free liberty for exporting the same</i>, and
the better to keep in and increase the current coin of
this kingdom, be it enacted that from and after the
1st day of August 1663 it shall and may be lawful to
and for any person or persons whatsoever to export
out of any port of England and Wales in which there
is a customer or collector, or out of the town of Berwick,
all sorts of foreign coin or bullion of gold or
silver, first making an entry thereof in such customhouse
respectively, without paying any duty, custom,
poundage, or fee for the same, any law, statute, or
usage to the contrary notwithstanding."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FREE TRADE IN THE PRECIOUS METALS</i></div>

<p>Standing so early and so almost completely alone
as it does, this Act evinces an unexampled prescience
and boldness. It doubtless reflects the commercial
traditions of Holland, but that it should have been at
a single stroke transferred to England at a time when
she was so economically different and distant from
Holland, needs make us pause in admiration. The<!-- Page 163 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
only parallel to it, if any, would arise if France should
suddenly, and by a single enactment, adopt to the full
the Free Trade policy of England. As a matter of
fact this Act of 1663 proved itself for a long time,
and through many oscillations, impossible of execution,
and far into the eighteenth century the British Government
meddled, by legislation and proclamation, with
the export of the precious metals, and with the tariff
of the coins, as will be seen immediately. It was not
till 1780 that a similar Act was passed for Ireland.</p>

<p>In 1803 the Lords of the Treasury were by statute
authorised to grant licences for the exportation of
silver bullion without any such certificate or document
whatsoever as had been required by the statute of
6 and 7 Wm. <span class="smcap">III.</span> c. 17, sect. 5.</p>

<p>It was almost a century after this action of England
that France followed in the same path. By
a proclamation of 7th October 1755, permission was
given to the free commerce in precious metals and
in foreign monies. But in the case of France, as in
that of England, the enactment was not immediately
nor fully realisable. The exportation of the national
specie was still forbidden, and more than once the
State found itself obliged to return to the question of
the tariffing of its coinage.</p>

<p>It is this vacillation&mdash;a vacillation, however, which
must in every instance be attributed to sheer State
necessity&mdash;which makes it impossible to trace in detail
and point by point the fall of so much of the Mercantile
System as concerned the regulating of international<!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
movements of metals. The <i>practice</i> of the commercial
world was doubtless in advance of the legislator's
standpoint, as indicated by such detached references,
and was effectual in completing the revolution silently
and under the surface, whether by the aid or in spite
of laws and proclamations. The same had been the
case, <i>e.g.</i>, with the old usury laws.</p>

<p>When effected there are two highly important
results which stand as the outcome of this change in
the theory of international commerce.</p>

<p>1. The perception of a right theory of international
balances opened the way to the separation of finance or
currency phenomena pure and simple, and so prepared
the ground for a scientific conception and treatment
of them. In one direction this treatment resulted in
the evolution of a theory and practice of a monometallic
system&mdash;one, <i>i.e.</i>, in which a single metal was made
the legal tender, and a second or third metal bound to
it in a hard-and-fast, subordinate relationship, so that
they could not by their oscillations injuriously affect
the tenderable metal. In another direction the same
scientific conception and treatment resulted in the
evolution (and after a time the practice) of a bimetallic
theory. Modern currency history hinges on the antagonism
of these two systems.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FUNCTION OF DISCOUNTS IN MODERN SYSTEM</i></div>

<p>This statement of the case will serve to show the
enormous difference between nineteenth-century currency
situations and problems <!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>and those of mediæval
and seventeenth-century Europe. To-day the point
at issue is between definitely and scientifically conceived
rival theories, and the <i>practical</i> difficulty before
the world is how to provide, not so much a permanent
ratio, as a permanent rate of international settlement
between countries using different monetary systems,
between silver-using and gold-using countries. In
the seventeenth century there was no conception of
theory at all, and the practical difficulty was how to
frustrate the operations of the bullionist and arbitragist
and politicians, and the depletion of national
treasure due to their activity, and based on a difference
of ratio prevailing in different countries.</p>

<p>2. The second practical outcome of the revolution
was the development of the modern system of control
of the flow of gold balances, viz. by means of the bank
rate and the arbitrage transactions depending thereon,
and on interest and discount rates generally.</p>

<p>The modern theory of international trade does not
say that between two particular countries, or at any
one particular point of time there is an equivalence of
exchange, but that between a circle of commercially
interconnected countries, and over a certain cycle of
time or operations, there is an equivalence of exchange
of goods and services. Movements of currency in the
most elementary form assist the process, as far as immediate
settlements are concerned; bills of exchange
assist it when there is need of deferred payments, as,
for instance, when a country imports steadily all the
year round, but has only one export time, say after
harvest; and, finally, bank and discount rates assist
the process by providing currency media at times and
places which would otherwise be unable to attract<!-- Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
a supply. Over the whole circle of completed operations
there is equilibrium of exchange, and the
machinery by which that equilibrium is accomplished
is currency in the widest sense. The index or
indicator and safety-valve of the whole is the rate
of interest. On these bank rates are based the
operations of the modern bullion dealers or arbitragists,
which serve to equalise or economise the distribution
of the precious metals all over the world.</p>

<p>It will be seen at a glance, therefore, that they
fulfil, in an automatic and perfectly natural manner,
all that was vainly attempted to be accomplished
by the repressive savage action of the State, and the
interfering unscientific handling of the Mint and coinage
rates. It is in this feature that the great distinction
between the modern and the seventeenth-century
world consists. Such a difference can only be based
upon, and have arisen from, a true theory of international
trade. But the process of development which
alone made it possible&mdash;the development of modern
banking, the invention of paper currency media, the
breaking down of international trade restrictions, all
the mechanical and scientific inventions which have
resulted in the binding of the world together in one
whole as far as commerce is concerned,&mdash;all this would
comprise in brief the essential features of the complete
commercial development of two centuries or
more, and how far they are related as cause or effect
it would be hard to say.</p>

<p>In this secondary period, therefore, the separate
history of each individual state gradually loses its<!-- Page 167 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
distinct or isolated importance, as far as mere Mint
edicts are concerned. As a consequence the bimetallic
action which we have hitherto sought in the
history of each individual currency must now increasingly
be sought in the wider field of the world currency,
that congeries or completed whole of currency
of which each national system now forms only a
part, and that not an independent part.</p>

<h5>France.</h5>

<p>In this third period the first change which France
made in her silver monies was in 1674, when she for
a time coined 4-sol. pieces of a quality below that
of the <i>écus blancs</i> by more than a fifth. A great
outcry was made by the Mint officers and mercantile
community against this money as implying a debasement.</p>

<p>In 1679 there was a noticeable quantity of Spanish
<i>pistoles</i> and large <i>écus d'or</i> in circulation, and as a
remedy it was ordered that they should be recoined
into <i>louis d'or</i> and <i>louis d'argent,</i> the King offering to
forego the seignorage as an inducement to bring
them to the Mint. In 1686, however, the louis d'or
itself was raised from 10 livres to 11 livres 10 sols.,
and the ratio thus changed to 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>. This being
found greatly in excess, in the following year it was<!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
lowered to 11 livres 5 sols. (a ratio of 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>). In
1689 both silver and gold were again raised,
the <i>louis d'or</i> to 11 livres 12 sols. and the <i>louis
d'argent</i> to 3 livres 2 sols., but almost immediately a
general recoinage was resolved upon. In this great
operation, effected towards the close of 1689, the
weight and standard of the previous coinage was
exactly retained, but the louis d'or was issued at
12 livres 10 sols. and the louis d'argent at 3 livres
6 sols. Only two years later again the standard
had to be altered, and the value of 1693 somewhat
raised. It will give some slight idea of the sapping
of the coinage that the pieces which in 1691 were
minted at 12 livres 10 sols. were, in 1693, called in
at a valuation of 11 livres 14 sols. The new species
of 1693 were issued at 13 livres and 3 livres 8 sols.
respectively.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRANCE: THE REFORM OF 1726</i></div>

<p>Ten years later a third recoinage was ordered,
the louis d'or being issued at 15 livres, and the louis
d'argent at 4 livres. By 1709 these species had
sunk in equivalence to 12 livres 15 sols. and 3 livres
8 sols. respectively. In that same year, however,
their issue value was raised to 20 livres and 5 livres.
This extraordinary and arbitrary action was greatly
to the detriment of French commerce, and the idea
was entertained of gradually reinducing the standard
of 14 livres and 3 livres 10 sols. This was ordered
by proclamation of 30th September 1713, which was
to continue in force till 1715. In the latter year a
reformation of the coinage was again undertaken, the<!-- Page 169 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
reformed species rising to 20 livres and 5 livres, and
the worn species remaining at 16 livres and 4 livres.
From this latter date up to 1721 the operations of
the financier John Law wrought great disasters in
the monies. At the time of the erection of the bank,
2nd May 1716, there were four species of <i>louis d'or</i>
and three of <i>louis d'argent</i>. By 1720 the former had
grown to forty in number and the latter to ten.
(For the disorders of the period of John Law, see
the account of French monetary system, <a href="#Page_396">Appendix VI.</a>)
It was to remedy this disorder that the great edict of
1726 was enacted. This edict, which formed the
basis of the French currency system almost up to
the days of the Revolution, prescribed the minting
of louis d'or at a tale of 30 to the mark, and issued at
a value of 20 livres; and of silver <span class="correction" title="corrected from 'ecus'">écus</span> at 8 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">10</span> to the
mark and issued at 5 livres&mdash;divisional coins in proportion.
The legal ratio was therefore 14 <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>. All
foreign coins and the ancient species of gold and
silver were decried, and ordered to be brought in for
reminting. All the prohibitive regulations of an old
régime against cutting and export, etc., were re-enacted
with severest penalties. But as the rate at which the
Mint was ordered to take in the old coinage did not
represent the commercial value at the moment, the
old coins were not brought in, and up to as late as
1749 the recoinage had not been accomplished,
although the Mint prices had been at different times
advanced on the whole a matter of 30 per cent. or
more. In 1759 the want of currency had become so
great that the King sent his plate to the Mint, and
numbers of private individuals followed his example,
receiving in reimbursement part payment at the rate
of 861 livres 5 sols. 10 den. for the mark of <!-- Page 170 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>fine gold,
and of 59 livres 5 sols. 10 den. for the mark of fine
silver.</p>

<p>This latter tariff underwent no change until 1771,
when, under the pretext of the changes which foreign
coinage tariffs had undergone, those terms were fixed
respectively at 709 livres and 48 livres 9 sols.</p>

<p>In this résumé the mention of billon money has
been generally avoided, as unduly complicating the
subject. But in the legislative action of France in
the eighteenth century there is one act which necessitates
a momentary departure from this standpoint.</p>

<p>In 1738 the Government of the United Provinces
diminished the value of their <i>sols.</i> by one-half. The
French Government fearing that this diminution
would lead to an immense influx of such sols. decided
to follow suit. By a decree of August 1st of the
same year, 1738, it was ordered that the <i>Douzains</i>
and pieces of thirty deniers should have course only
for eighteen deniers. The important point to notice
in connection with this is that, in order to mitigate
the effect of this reduction, the same decree limited
the tender of such billon money. It was ordered that
in payments up to 400 livres not more than 10 livres
should be tenderable in billon, and for payments of
more than 400 livres not more than  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">40</span> of the total.
The restriction was ineffectual in preventing either
the import of foreign billon specie or the operations
of billonage or arbitrage, based on the differentiated
value of the various kinds of billon circulating. This
is quite evident from the preamble <!-- Page 171 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> of the edict of the
following October, 1738, which attempted the calling
in of the 30-denier pieces, in order to put a stop to
the process.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRANCE: THE REFORM OF 1785</i></div>

<p>Such a failure is quite in keeping with all previous
experience as recorded in these pages, and deserves
no special reference. The point to note is rather the
gradual evolution and adoption of the idea of limiting
the tender of the lower species, so as to contract their
action on the main species of the currency. This
idea forms the complement of the idea of an agio,
involved in the issue of fractional coins on a lower
standard or basis than that of the greater specie.
The one idea was&mdash;in long, over-long, periods <i>i.e.</i>&mdash;impracticable
without the other; but together, when
finally evolved, thoroughly seized and put in practice,
they formed the main basis of the truest modern
currency system.</p>

<p>To return to the pure gold and silver species.
The basis of 1726 remained at law unaltered until
1785. The edict of the 30th October of that year
commanded a recoinage; no change was made in the
silver coinage, which remained according to the tariff
of May 1773, namely, 52 livres 9 sols. 2 den. to the
mark fine. By the alteration of the tariff of gold, however,
to 828 livres 12 sols. to the mark fine, the ratio
of 14 <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>, which had nominally prevailed since 1726, was
altered to the memorable 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>. The reason was explicitly
stated to be the increase in the value of gold
during several preceding years&mdash;an increase which
had banished or detained gold from the French Mint
and even from France.</p>

<p>Writing in 1785, the minister, Calonne, who
proposed and executed the recoinage in that year,<!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
spoke thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In 1726 the legal ratio was fixed in France at
14 marks 5 oz. of silver, to a mark of gold, and that
which proves with how much sagacity this point was
seized is the fact that during a long course of years
France retained in her circulating medium a sufficiently
large proportion of each metal. Nevertheless,
her gold gradually became less common, and for some
years this scarcity has rapidly increased, and this
precisely because its legal value has always remained
the same, while its metallic value has increased from
year to year."</p>

<p>He estimated the amount of livres in <i>louis d'or</i>
existing in the country at the time of the recoinage,
1785, as 650 million livres, which amounted to only
a half of the total coinage (1300 million livres)
of the period 1726-85. What seems to have
determined Calonne to adopt 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> was the fact that
Spain had the legal ratio of 16, and that there was a
probability that, in future, gold would rise in value.
As for the market price, he admits that it was only
15.08-15.12 in 1785. The recoinage, therefore,
brought a profit of 7,255,216 livres to the King's
purse, and a profit of 21,600,000 livres to the holders
of the old <i>louis d'or</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRANCE: CALONNE'S POLICY IN 1785</i></div>

<p>His policy was severely criticised in a report<!-- Page 173 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
made in 1790 to the National Assembly, which proposed
a silver standard, with an authorised circulation
of gold coins at the ratio of 14 <span class="above">7</span>&#8260;<span class="below">9</span> and the abolition of
seigniorage. It is well known that this was nearer to
the market rate. Calonne's ratio, therefore, must be
regarded as arbitrary and designing. Practically, the
latter recommendation of the committee's paper of
1790 had been conceded in the decree of 30th
October 1785, as the seigniorage was by it allowed to
be no more than the net cost of reminting.</p>

<p>By this celebrated edict of Calonne's, which also
enacted a recoinage, the right of seigniorage was
practically finally relinquished for France. Fixity was
given to silver as the principal money, and a definite
ratio was established at which gold was to circulate by
its side. In these, its chief points or characteristics, it
formed the exact model for the later Act of Republican
France, which is ignorantly looked upon as having
created the bimetallic system. The Act of 7 Germinal
an <span class="smcap">XI.</span> did but re-enact and perpetuate the edict of
1785.</p>

<p>It is important to reaffirm and emphasise this
point, as quite wild and blind estimates have been
formed of the later action of Republican France. In
merest fact, that later action created no new order, it
instituted no new idea, it did not even promulgate its
own theory.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRANCE: CURRENCY LEGISLATION AT REVOLUTION</i></div>

<p><!-- Page 174 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>Republican France began her reform of the
currency in a very temporary and opportunist manner
by issuing a mass of inferior monies of 15 and 30
sous pieces to form the basis of the assignats, and to
replace the gold and silver which had almost entirely
disappeared from circulation. In the decree of 16
Vendémière an <span class="smcap">II.</span> (7th October 1793), however, the
question of standard was approached, and decided in
a remarkable manner. The monetary unit was
decreed to consist of the hundredth part of a
kilogram, named <i>grave</i>, represented (1) by a piece
of silver  <span class="above">9</span>&#8260;<span class="below">10</span> fine and weighing 10 grms., (2) by a
piece of gold of the same weight and standard, to be
current at 15 times the value of the silver piece.</p>

<p>This decree remained a dead letter, and two years
later the <i>franc</i> was definitively adopted as the base of
the French system. As determined by the two laws
of 28 Thermidor an <span class="smcap">III.</span> (15th August 1795), that
system was based upon the silver franc (weighing
5 grms.  <span class="above">9</span>&#8260;<span class="below">10</span> fine). A gold coinage was ordained,
of the same fineness, in a piece of 10 grms. weight,
but the ratio of value of the gold to the unit franc
was not fixed. This was exactly the monetary
system which Mirabeau had counselled in his memoirs
to the Assembly in 1790. The silver <i>5-franc</i> pieces
prescribed under this system found acceptance, the
bronze pieces were refused and had to be withdrawn,
and as to the gold piece, its issue was not even
attempted. Two years later the "Directoire" pronounced
in favour of maintaining the 10-grm. piece of
gold, but demanded the fixation of its value, proposing
a ratio of 16:1. In opposition to this scheme, Prieur
submitted to the "Council of the Five Hundred"
a project adopting the silver and gold coinage, as<!-- Page 175 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
already determined as above, but leaving the value of
the gold piece to fluctuate according to the market,
its value being declared twice annually by public
announcement. After being materially altered in the
"Council of the Five Hundred," this scheme was
definitively rejected by the "Council of Senators,"
and for several years the question of the monetary
system of the Republic was allowed to slumber.
When, in the year <span class="smcap">X.</span>, the consideration of the
subject was resumed, it was at the instigation of the
Consuls. At their desire the Minister of Finance,
Gaudin, laid before the Council of State a scheme in
which he proposed the issue of 20 and 40-franc gold
pieces, of a value based on the ratio enunciated in the
edict of 1785, namely, 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>. He was, at the same time,
careful to explain that silver remained the basis of
the currency, and that the gold money could be
reissued if a different market compelled a change in
the ratio. In his report to the Consuls, Gaudin admits
that the commercial ratio had for a long time been
under 15. The decisive point which led him to
maintain the ratio established in 1785 was, that to
change the <i>status quo</i> by the adoption of 15 as a
ratio would occasion great loss to the holder of gold
coins, and that there was no sufficient reason for so
great a change.</p>

<p>The Financial Committee of the Council of State
at first rejected the scheme, preferring that of Prieur,
already described, but on an inquest, ordered by the
First Consul, who insisted on pressing the matter to
a conclusion, M. Gaudin carried his propositions<!-- Page 176 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
through the Council of State, but with the important
difference that the reference to any future change in
the ratio of gold to the basis of silver was tacitly
dropped. These propositions became the foundation
of the law of 7-17 Germinal an <span class="smcap">XI.</span> (28th March 1803),
on which the monetary system of Republican France
was finally built.</p>

<p>The <i>exposé des motifs</i> of this law speaks of the
gold coins in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The gold pieces up to the present in circulation
are the pieces of 24 and 48 livres tournois. Article
6 of this law substitutes in their place pieces of 20
and 40 francs. The adoption of the decimal system
necessitates this change, which brings all parts of the
system into accord. It is on the same <span class="correction" title="corrected from 'conideration'">consideration</span>
that the standard is fixed at  <span class="above">9</span>&#8260;<span class="below">10</span>, like that of silver."</p>

<p>Not a word is said as to the ratio, and much more
stress is laid upon the suppression of billon money
and on the abolition of seigniorage, as of greater
importance and benefit to the nation's interests. By
this law of Germinal <span class="smcap">XI.</span> the monetary unit of the
French system was declared to be the silver franc,
weighing 5 grms. of  <span class="above">9</span>&#8260;<span class="below">10</span> standard. By the side of
this franc and its multiples, were to be issued gold
pieces of 20 and 40 francs, valued on a basis ratio of
15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> to the silver.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRANCE: THE REFORM OF 1803</i></div>

<p><!-- Page 177 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>It will be seen at a glance from the course of this
previous history that this law instituted no new
principle, or theory, or system in French currency.
The decimal system was adopted in place of the old
system of livres tournois, seigniorage was abolished,
and fixation of value given to the unit money, and
billon money discontinued. But in matter of standard
and system there was not even innovation. The
system of Republican France, as established by this
law, was no more and no less bimetallic than in 1785,
or than in 1610, or in the days of Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span>
Theories as such did not occupy the mind of the
legislator, and of any conception of a bimetallic
theory or system such as we have learned to know
there is no trace. The First Consul found at hand
the two metals which had formed the currency of his
country for centuries. The problem of their regulation
was the same which had been faced by his
predecessors for centuries, and he settled it in the
same practical untheoretic way.</p>

<p>It was only gradually that in its totality of coins
the French monetary system was made to conform to
the metric system thus established. The old gold
coins of 12, 24, and 48 livres were not suppressed
until June 1829, the actual extinction of billon money
was only accomplished in 1845, and the recoinage of
the inferior monies in 1852-56. But such are mere
matters of detail and apart from the subject.</p>

<p>The experience of France under this new régime
is, therefore, in no wise different <i>in kind</i><!-- Page 178 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>> from such
experience as has been described for the preceding
centuries. It is not until the broaching of a bimetallic
theory as such, and until the expression of that
theory, as a theory, in the formation of the Latin
Union, that anything like a special significance
attaches to the monetary system and experience of
France in the nineteenth century, any more, <i>e.g.</i>, than
in the seventeenth. The main difference in the
situation was not that France had changed her
system, and that her experience was henceforth
different and of different signification, but that
England had changed hers, and that the brunt of the
fluctuations of the precious metals about a fixed ratio
was left to be borne by a smaller area. The influence
and the instance is, therefore, more telling in degree,
but in no way different in kind.</p>

<p>The second idea which is commonly entertained
with regard to the action of France during this later
period, viz. that her action secured for the world at
large a fixed and steady ratio, is equally&mdash;indeed, still
more&mdash;fallacious. At no point of time during the
present century has the actual market ratio, dependent
on the commercial value of silver, corresponded with
the French ratio of 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>, and at no point of time has
France been free from the disastrous influence of that
want of correspondence between the legal and the
commercial ratio. The opposite notion, which
prevails and finds expression in the ephemeral
bimetallic literature of to-day, is simply due to
ignorance. From 1815 England has been withdrawn
from this action of a bimetallic law, and the modern
insular pamphleteer has before his eyes no sign of <!-- Page 179 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>its
workings in his own country. He therefore assumes
an universality of such experience, and attributes it to
the French legislative ratio. It is in no polemic
spirit, but simply in the interest of science that this
particular misapplication of history to the squaring
of a theory is to be branded. The plainest facts of
history are thereby absolutely misrepresented, and the
assumption of cause and effect is so far from being
true that the repose of the English currency history
in the nineteenth century is to be attributed to the
<i>absence</i> of a bimetallic system; to its despite rather
than its presence and influence. To instance only
by France for the moment.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRANCE: COURSE OF THE RATIO</i></div>

<p>The course of the actual or market ratio has been
already stated in the table (<i>supra</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_157">157</a>-<a href="#Page_159">59</a>). In
the graphic representation of this (<i>opposite</i>) the legal
ratio of 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> is represented by the fixed line <i>x.y.</i>, the
actual ratio by the fluctuating black line <i>z</i>. At no
point do these lines coincide. After three years of
fluctuations, 1803-06, now above and now below, the
ratio sinks persistently below for seven years,
1807-13, touching the lowest point (a ratio of 16.24)
in 1813. For the succeeding five or six years,
1813-19, the ratio was as consistently above the
legal rate, though with less violence and width of
divergence. From the latter year, 1819, up to 1850,
its course was undeviatingly below 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>, then from
1851-67&mdash;the period, <i>i.e.</i>, of the great<!-- Page 180 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> gold outputs
of Australia and America&mdash;as undeviatingly above.
From the last-named date until the close of the
bimetallic system in France, and, indeed, up to our
own days, the course of the commercial ratio has been
again unbrokenly below the 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> ratio, and, as is too
well known, with an ever-increasing enormity of
divergence.</p>

<p>So much for the claim that the French law has
dowered the world with a steady ratio.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, what has been the influence of this
divergence of the commercial from the legal ratio
upon France's store of precious metals? It has been
exactly similar in effect and force with that wielded
by similar trains of event and circumstance, in the
monetary history of France during the four preceding
centuries. The exact official figures of the import
and export of gold and silver are not obtainable
before 1822, and in a continuous stream not before
1830 (separably for the two metals, that is to say).<a name="FNanchor_15_19" id="FNanchor_15_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_19" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRANCE: BIMETALLIC EXPERIENCE, 1803-75</i></div>

<p>From the latter date, however, the testimony of
the figures is as explicit as it is forceful. From 1830
to 1850, while the ratio remained continually below
the legal 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>, there was a profit on the import of
silver, and a persistent and heavy import took place.
In 1830 the (balance of the) silver imported
amounted to a matter of 6 millions sterling, in <!-- Page 181 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> 1831
to 7 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> millions, in 1834 to 4 millions, in 1837 to over
5 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> millions, in 1838 to nearly 5 millions, in 1841 to
nearly 5 millions, in 1843 over 4 millions, in 1848
to over 8 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> millions, and in 1849 to nearly 10 millions.
There was not a single year that was not accompanied
by this import, and over the whole twenty-two years
the total of importations reached the enormous
figure of, approximately, 92 millions sterling. It
must be clearly understood that this sum represents
not the gross but the net importation or balance of
imports over exports, and that the money passed into
the currency of the country, taking its place as such
and displacing gold <i>pari passu</i>. The movement of
gold in the same time is represented by the red line
in the accompanying diagram. Within the limits of
very considerable exceptions, the correspondence of
its fluctuations with those of gold is clearly perceptible.
The silver, on whose coinage a profit or
premium was offered by the existing French law to
individuals, could only be bought or paid for by the export
of gold or services and goods. During these years,
1830-50, it was quite apparently by the latter method,
namely, by remittance of goods, as on the whole
period there is a slight gain of gold, nearly 3 millions,
contrary to what bimetallic law would have led to
expect. The correspondence, however&mdash;a simultaneity&mdash;of
the two movements, of import of silver and
export of gold, is strongly marked in the years
1834-39 and 1841-48, and the failure of correspondence
of the totals is to be explained by the statistics
of French foreign trade balances during the years
named.</p>

<p>With the year 1852, the decisive change in the
ratio sets in with the new gold influx.<!-- Page 182 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> The ratio
rises above the 15.5 of the French law, and the profit
on the importation and coining of silver vanishes. Its
place is taken by a corresponding profit on the
importation and coinage of gold. The fourteen years
during which the ratio remained above the legal 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>
witnessed the importation into France of a total net
(or balance) of gold to the amount of 135 millions
sterling, and a total net or balance of exportation of
silver of 66 <span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> millions sterling. The coincidence of
actual fluctuation will best be seen by the graphic
representation of it in the table. With 1865 the
final and, so far as the nineteenth century is concerned,
the fatal change of the commercial ratio sets
in. It sinks persistently and increasingly below the
legal 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>, in face and spite of the united mintings of
the Latin Union, and at once the premium on the importation
and coinage of gold changes into one on
silver. From 1865 to 1875, one year before the
abandonment of the coinage of the 5-franc piece and
the consequent relinquishment by France of the
bimetallic system, her net imports of silver amounted
to 56 millions sterling.</p>

<p>As far as these figures of import and export are
concerned, they show only the <i>final</i> results of the
action of bimetallic law. The metal on whose
importation and minting a premium was obtainable
<i>was</i> imported, and in large quantities. That is the
single fact standing out in large. The reciprocal fact&mdash;of
a corresponding export of the metal over whose<!-- Page 183 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
head the premium offered&mdash;does not emerge so
distinctly, simply by reason of the complication of the
subject of exports of metals with the wider general
movement of trade balances. It also is, however,
distinctly perceptible and demonstrable. But this is
to speak only in large and of final results. What the
intermediate course of events&mdash;of see-saw and flux,
was, can only be adequately grasped from the records
of the mintings, conjoined with the records of net
import or export of the two metals.</p>

<p>The statistics of the Latin Union, up to the suspension
of the bimetallic system will be separately
dealt with.</p>

<p>Speaking only of the experience of France during
these years of bimetallic régime, the ebbing and<!-- Page 187 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
flowing experience which has throughout been instanced
as the chief characteristic of such régime is
most strongly marked. The legal ratio did not give
the market ratio, and so far was it from giving France
a stable currency, it was the one thing which unsettled
it and made a stable currency impossible. The
<i>exposé des motifs</i> of the law of 1876, which will be
referred to in another connection below, puts the
matter with official brevity. "The variations of the
commercial from legal 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> ratio remained normal
during the years 1824-67. All the same they
sufficed to modify greatly the composition of the
French circulation. After the predominance of
silver, which became marked in 1847, the ratio from
1847-67 introduced gold in a large proportion, and
measures had to be taken to retain in France
the smaller silver coinage. Our silver <i>monnaie
d'appoint</i> of .835 fine was created for this purpose."</p>

<p>To regard this question from a theoretic and
international point of view, to the exclusion of any
regard for the separate national interests of France,
is a sheer absurdity. It mattered little or nothing
to France that by unloading the stores of silver she
happened to possess at the time of the gold discoveries
of the Fifties she helped to steady the
ratio for the world at large. It did however matter,
and very much, that this process of exchange from
the one metal to the other was attended with public
loss, balanced only by illicit private gain, and with
a disturbance of trade in every town of France <!-- Page 188 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
through the disappearance of the smaller silver specie.
Whether or not France or any other country is called
upon to sacrifice herself thus&mdash;not once but every
time the ratio fluctuates from below to above the
legal ratio or <i>vice versa</i>&mdash;for the sake of an ideal,
bimetallic, regulating, function, let common sense
decide.</p>

<p>The French monetary commission of 1867 speaks
thus of the situation&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is well known by all that this ratio [of 1803]
by the simple reason of its being fixed could not
remain correct. There was quickly a premium on
gold, and silver remained almost alone in circulation
until near 1850. The discovery of the mines of
California and Australia suddenly changed this situation
by throwing into the European market a very
considerable quantity of gold. By the side of this
force, which tended to create a divergence from the
legal ratio by lowering gold, there was another which
occasioned a rise of silver. Under the influence of
various circumstances, too long to enumerate, the
needs of the extreme East had grown in unusual
proportions, and as silver is alone in favour there, it
was exported in enormous masses. There was a
premium on silver to the extent of 8 per mille, and it
disappeared almost completely from circulation, yielding
place to gold.</p>

<p>"Preoccupied by the situation the Government
charged a commission to study the measures to be
taken. Its labours are summed up in the report of<!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
M. de Bosredon (1857). After examining the system
tending to preserve silver money intact by lowering
the value of gold money, and conversely the system
tending to the adoption of the gold standard by
reducing the silver money to the state of billon, the
commission did not decide between them. It confined
itself, in fact, to counselling the Government
to a transitory step&mdash;the raising of the export duties
on silver.... The exportation of silver, therefore,
continued; and if the disappearance of 5-franc
pieces was not remarked, because they were replaced
by gold, it was not the same with the scarcity
of pieces of a smaller value employed in petty
payments.</p>

<p>"Being informed of the obstruction to retail commerce
by complaints carried before the Senate, and
instructed by the example of Switzerland, which had
in 1860 reduced the standard of its divisional money,
the Minister of Finance appointed a commission, 1861,
to study the remedy to be applied to the evil. This
commission counselled the reduction of the standard
of pieces of less than 5-francs to .834 fine. It did
this in complete knowledge of the cause, fully recognising
that in so doing the monetary unity of
silver, characteristic of our system, would be thereby
broken, at anyrate for its circulating form; for while
the franc no longer existed in law, the 5-franc was
disappearing in fact, so that the change was equivalent
to the establishment of a gold standard."</p>

<p>This advice of the commission was however, by<!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the law of 1864, applied only to pieces of 50 or
20 centimes.</p>

<p>The next step in the process was the formation of
the Latin Union in the year following. The above-quoted
commission speaks of the intentional aspect
of this Union in these words: "This convention
places in the front rank gold money, and reduces
the pieces of silver of 2 francs and less to the
<i>rôle</i> of token money. It therefore definitely determines
[<i>consacre</i>] the ascendency of the gold francs,
and solves practical difficulties arising from the
double standard."</p>

<p>This was written in 1867, less than two years after
the formation of the Latin Union. It is not the view
which prevails among bimetallists to-day as to the purpose
and intentional bearing of that Union; but it is
the historic truth none the less, and it was only the
complete revolution in the conditions of production of
the precious metals which made itself felt from 1871,
which has given the Latin Union the aspect of a
theoretic concert for the maintenance of, rather than
as a defence against, a bimetallic system. If silver
had not fallen in 1871 the Latin Union would still
be the bulwark of defence of bimetallic France
against the action of bimetallic law.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE LATIN UNION</i></div>

<p>The formation of the Latin Union, therefore, was a
measure of defence against the action of the bimetallic
system in those countries which had adopted the
monetary system of France, and lay exposed to all its
disastrous fluctuations. The first and moving factor<!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
in its formation was Belgium. So far as related to
silver, Belgium had adopted the French system by her
monetary law of 5th June 1832. By the first article
of this law the monetary unit was fixed at the silver
franc of 5 grms. weight, and 9 fineness. For
years Belgium endeavoured to maintain this law in
its integrity. Public opinion, however, demanded the
admission of French gold at its normal value, and
this was conceded and decreed by the law of 4th
June 1861. From that moment she felt all the
oscillating movement which France was experiencing.
The declaration of Article 1. of the law of 1832
became a dead letter; the gold standard took the
place of the silver standard, and equally with France,
Italy, and Switzerland, Belgium had to witness the
disappearance of her small silver coins. To the
previous abundance there succeeded a penury of
small change, although the drain was not so immediately
felt because of large reserve of silver 5-franc
pieces (amounting to 48 millions of francs) held by
the National Bank. In slightly over a year, 1st June
1861 to 8th November 1862, this stock of 48,645,000
francs had sunk to 14,629,000 francs, and in alarm the
National Bank ceased, on the latter date, all payments
in 5-franc pieces. Concurrently with this drain of the
5-franc pieces, the reserve of silver coins of less value
began to be seriously affected by the sapping influence.
During the two following years, 1861-63, there
was little commerce in the precious metals owing to
the American war. But in 1863 the movement of<!-- Page 192 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
drain recommenced. The reserve of 5-franc pieces
and the stock of divisional coins of lower denomination
fell rapidly, to so low a point indeed as to
become quite insufficient for the ordinary trade and
small change demanded of the country. After a slight
recovery in September 1865, the same downward
course continued. The smaller coins, of 1-franc
piece, and 50 centimes became so scarce that the
bank could not supply the demands of manufacturers
for the payment of wages, and the Government had to
have resort to the coinage of nickel for small divisional
money. The simultaneous experience of Switzerland
and Italy is not so capable of statement and
exact expression. But it was similar in kind. Previous
to 1865 a net balance of over 12 millions sterling (consisting
almost if not entirely of silver) had left Italy,
and it was known to be the danger of entirely losing
her silver which led Italy to the suspension of cash
payments on 30th April 1866, and to her acquiescence
in the Latin Union. It was not, however, Italy, but
Belgium who first raised the note of alarm. Conscious
that her monetary community with France
made any independent efforts quite futile, the
Belgium Government proposed to France a monetary
union for all the countries which had adopted the
franc as the basis of their currency. Taking up the
proposition France invited Italy and Switzerland,
together with Belgium, to send delegates to a
monetary conference at Paris. At this conference
Belgium proposed the adoption of the single gold<!-- Page 193 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
standard&mdash;the silver pieces including the 5-franc
pieces to be lowered by an agio, and made divisional
money. Italy and Switzerland were of the same
opinion, but their scheme failed before the opposition
of France, and the final outcome of the conference
was the establishment of the convention of 23rd
December 1865.</p>

<p>This convention, which instituted the Latin Union,
came into force on the 17th of August 1869; and
under it one slight change was made in the internal
currency system of France. The hitherto full-valued
silver coinage from 2 francs downwards was changed
into token money (being reduced to .835 fine), the
5-franc piece remaining as full legal tender.</p>

<p>The union was to last for fifteen years. It established
an identity in the monetary system of the
four powers, as far as weight and standard were
concerned, and prescribed free coinage for any
individuals bringing metals to the Mints&mdash;of gold
into any form, and of silver into 5-franc pieces;
and reciprocal acceptance of those pieces in any of
the States of the union. Finally the minting of each
State for national or currency purposes was limited
to 6 francs per head.</p>

<p>This limitation, together with the regulation
adopted, that the divisional coins should be issued
at a rate inferior to that of the monetary standard,
must be regarded as a measure of mutual defence
against the sapping of the small coinage which had
previously been experienced. According to this<!-- Page 194 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
clause the maximum of mintings for national or
currency purposes was presented thus&mdash;</p>

<p>For a time everything bloomed, the minting went
merrily on, and private individuals (foreigners)
reaped a profit at the expense of France. With the
heavy fall in the ratio which made itself marked
in 1873, however, events became too strong even for
the Union, and Belgium took the initiative by passing
a law enabling her Government to suspend or
limit the coinage of the 5-franc piece. This principle
was subsequently adopted by all the states of the
Latin Union. During the years, 1874-76, three
annual conferences of the Union were held at Paris,
with the result that the limitation of the coinage of
the 5-franc piece was fixed thus&mdash;</p>

<p>Of these states Switzerland alone did not coin up
to her total, and at the conference in February 1876
her delegates pressed strongly for the entire cessation
of the coinage of the 5-franc piece, and for the
adoption of a gold standard. In this she was<!-- Page 195 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
strongly opposed by Italy. The latter state, on
account of the disappearance of her metallic currency
before the inconvertible paper, had no interest in the
limitation of the mintings of the Union. In the
conference of 1874 she even sought and was
authorised to coin beyond the quota accorded her,
by a sum of not less than £800,000 in 5-franc pieces,
on condition that such amount should be deposited as
a metallic reserve of the Bank of Italy.</p>

<p>The force of circumstances, however, soon broke
down even this policy of limitation. In the course
of 1876 the fall of silver became more disastrously
pronounced. In addition, it was no secret that the
amounts accorded by the conferences of 1874-75-76
for the mintings of each state, had been assigned
as maximum, not minimum limits, under the Latin
Union.<a name="FNanchor_16_20" id="FNanchor_16_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_20" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The next Mint convention of November 1878
would determine the Latin Union on the 31st December
1885, if not prolonged by further treaty. As the
time approached the smaller states, such as Belgium,
which had committed themselves to a large minting
and thereby to the liability of having to liquidate or
take back its own mintings&mdash;such 5-franc pieces as
happened to be beyond its frontiers&mdash;at full value, in<!-- Page 196 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
the face of a greatly fallen silver market, shrank from
the responsibility, and sought and obtained a prolongation
of the <i>status quo</i> until the end of 1891,
and thenceforward by yearly agreement.</p>

<p>Finding that individuals treated the agreed
amounts of mintings as a minimum limit, the French
Government resolved to suspend the minting of the
5-franc pieces entirely. Accordingly, on the 21st
March 1876, M. Léon Say, Minister of Finance,
submitted to the Senate a Bill to that effect. It was
followed, eight days later, by a proposition of a law
suspending the emission of "<i>bons</i>" for the coining of
silver money  <span class="above">9</span>&#8260;<span class="below">10</span> fine. The <i>exposé des motifs</i> of this
Act is most remarkable:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The events which have happened for some time
past in the relations of the precious metals have
brought to a head the monetary question amongst us,
although from 1815 Great Britain has laid down
principles which have attracted round her an ever-increasing
circle of nations.</p>

<p>"The theory of the double standard, on which our
monetary law of the year <span class="smcap">XI.</span> reposes, has been called
in question ever since its origin.</p>

<p>"It is, to our conception, less a theory than the
result of the primitive inability of the legislators to
combine together the two precious metals otherwise
than by way of an unlimited concurrence&mdash;metals,
both of which are destined to enter into the monetary
system, but which recent legislators have learned to
co-ordinate by leaving the unlimited function to gold <!-- Page 197 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
alone and reducing silver to the rôle of divisional
money. From 1857 the French Government has
studied the question, and it may be stated that since
that date the principle of the gold standard has won
increasing favour through our several administrations."</p>

<p>Then follows an account of the monetary history
of France during the period, as in brief résumé
already given. "If," the preamble continues, "from
1874, certain precautions had not been taken to arrest
the effects of that grave perturbation in the ratio,
France and her monetary allies would have seen
their monetary circulation invaded by silver and
correspondingly drained of gold." Hence the conventions
of 1874-75-76, limiting the mintings of the
members of the Latin Union, although, "according
to us, the fall of silver in 1875 prescribed a complete
cessation even for that year rather than a simple
limitation."</p>


<h5>Germany.</h5>

<p>Until the unification of Germany in our own days,
and the adoption of the present imperial currency
system, German monetary history reproduces perpetually
all the elements of that mediæval system,
bimetallic in fact though not theoretically so conceived,
which England flung away in 1816, and from
the toils of which France has not as yet completely
emerged.</p>

<p>As safeguards against the evils of that system
which she had felt with such bitter experience, and<!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
which had culminated in the crisis closing the Thirty
Years' War, Germany could only feebly employ the
mechanism of ineffectual Mint conventions. For a
century she persevered in the effort to establish a
common standard and Mint system, but in vain.
The attempt had to be abandoned, and the reeling
system left to its own process of disintegration; and
when at last the events of 1871 came to give her
unity in her coinage, as well as political life, there
were not less than nine distinct and independent
coinage systems in existence.</p>

<p>Hardly had the crisis of the Thirty Years' War
passed out of mind before again the currency system
had begun to work its baneful effects.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GERMANY: THE ZINNAISCHE STANDARD</i></div>

<p>In 1665 complaints were loudly made of the
corrupt and debased state of the coin, due to export
and culling. There is, indeed, quite a literature of
these same complaints. The language of the <i>Reichstattisches
conclusum</i> (Ratisbon, 12th September 1666)
expressly attributes this export to the higher value
set upon the gold in foreign countries, especially
Venice. And the statement of the warden of the
Mint of the three corresponding circles&mdash;Franconia,
Bavaria, and <span class="correction" title="corrected from 'Suabia'">Swabia</span>&mdash;delivered in his <i>Gutachten</i> of
the preceding May, was that the place of these good
German ducats had been taken by very depreciated
coins of Italy, France, England, and Holland. The
three higher circles, accordingly&mdash;Franconia, Bavaria,
and Swabia&mdash;met in conference and determined on a
thorough investigation. The advice submitted to<!-- Page 199 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
them was to raise the thaler from 90 to 96-kreutzer
(see account of German coinage, <a href="#Page_360">Appendix V.</a>), implying
a lowering of the ratio from 15 to 14 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>. This
proposed scheme was accepted, <i>in comitia</i>, in 1667,
the fifth article of the resolution specially mentioning
the infliction of numerous intruding base foreign
divisional money. From this scheme Brandenburg
and Saxony held off, maintaining that the ratio had
not been sufficiently lowered, considering the condition
of the production of gold; and, in the same
year, by a Mint treaty between Frederick William
of Brandenburg and the Elector of Saxony, the
so-called <i>Zinnaische</i> standard was adopted for those
two states. According to this standard, the Reichs
thaler was raised to 105-kreutzer (1 florin 45 kreutzers)
and a ratio of 13 <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">9</span> was established.</p>

<p>The result of this action of Saxony and Brandenburg
was to strip the three higher circles of their
silver, and in two years (1669) they anxiously met
again to consider the question, not only of the foreign
base coin everywhere prevalent, but also of the
damaging exchange "and ceaseless melting down
and exchange of proper coin from the circles."</p>

<p>By a strenuous effort the three circles carried
through the Reichstag of 1680 their resolution to
reduce the Reichs thaler to 90 kreutzer (ratio 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>).
From this decision the Emperor stood apart, with
Bavaria and Salzburg, in putting the Reichs thaler at
96 kreutzer.</p>

<p>In view of such contrariety the impossibility <!-- Page 200 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> of
any general régime for the empire became apparent,
and further attempts at it were practically abandoned.
It was the perception by the mercantile community,
as well as by the various Governments, of the consequences
of such disorder, that led to the establishment
of the so-called Leipzig standard in 1690.
This standard was promoted by John George <span class="smcap">III.</span> of
Saxony, and established by treaty between Saxony,
Brandenburg, and Brunswick-Luneburg. According
to it the Reichs thaler was raised to 120 kreutzers,
or 2 florins, the mark being minted into 12 thalers or
18 guldens.</p>

<p>The result of the introduction of this standard was
that in a few years the raising of the Reichs thaler to
120 kreutzers prevailed all over the empire. Sweden
accepted it in the same year, 1690, and three years
later the three upper circles acquiesced. At the same
time the gold gulden was advanced to 2 florins 56
kreutzers. The previous ratio of 15 was thereby
advanced to 15.1 (15 <span class="above">128</span>&#8260;<span class="below">1278</span>).</p>

<p>In 1738 the Reichstag determined on the adoption
of the Leipzig standard for the whole empire; no
alteration was made in the Reichs thaler, which was
still retained at 2 florins and minted at 12 to the mark
fine; but a graduated scale of agio was adopted for the
divisional coins, which were minted at an equivalence
of from 12 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> to 13 <span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> thalers to the mark fine. The
difference (varying from  <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> to 1 <span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> thalers) represented
the agio.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GERMANY: THE CONVENTION STANDARD</i></div>

<p>From the first, however, the Leipzig standard<!-- Page 201 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
had no more real success than any of its predecessors.
Although theoretically accepted by all
North Germany, and adopted in the Reichstag in
1738, it could obtain no actual general adoption
through the empire. Even from the moment of the
inception of the system in 1690, the process of competitively
raising the course of the coinage had still
continued, and pieces of 30, 20, 15, and 10-kreutzers
were struck on a basis of from 20 to 21 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> gulden to
the mark. The result was to put upon the <i>carolus</i>,
which from 1730 onwards was minted in great quantities
in South-West Germany, an agio of 10 per
cent., a differentiation which was much increased by
the disorders of the war of the Austrian succession.
Such an agio swiftly drove the larger, full-valued
specie out of currency, and during the continuance of
that war the currency of Austria and South Germany
was almost entirely reduced to depreciated fractional
pieces, while the exchangers reaped untold advantage.
It was on the close of this war, in 1748, that, with
characteristic Austrian selfishness, though also with a
boldness none of his predecessors had approached,
the Emperor, Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span>, determined on the erection
of the 20-gulden standard as a separate Austrian
independent system, minting the mark of fine silver
into 13 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> Reichs thalers, or 20 guldens. This latter
system, after the accession to it of Bavaria, obtained
the name of the Convention Standard, and the 2-gulden
pieces minted under it are styled the Species or Convention
Thaler. The convention system remained <!-- Page 202 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
in force in Austria until the Vienna Coinage Convention
of 1857, a period during which the <i>Convention
Thaler</i> found wide circulation through South
Germany.</p>

<p>The currency was eked out by the Austrian gold
ducats and by vast quantities of foreign silver,
French <i>6-livre thalers</i> (current for 2 florins 48
kreutzers) and the <i>crown</i> or <i>Brabant thaler</i> (current for
2 florins 42 kreutzers). From 1807 onwards this
latter coin was imitated by the South German States,
Bavaria especially, in their <i>crown thaler</i>, minted on a
fresh basis of 24 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> guldens to the mark of fine silver.</p>

<p>The selfish initiative of Austria was followed by
Prussia and the South German States. The latter,
the Rhenish and South German States, adopted in
1761-65 the 24-gulden; subsequently changed into
the 24 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-gulden standard (see <a href="#Page_396">Appendix VI.</a>). The
overvaluation of the <i>Kronthaler</i>, which led to that
latest development from a 24 to a 24 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-gulden standard,
was the result of the immense circulation of French
6-livre pieces (known in Germany as <i>Laubthalers</i>) in
South-West Germany. Graumann quite discredits
the theory that the overswimming of South Germany
by these French pieces, with all the confusion in
the currency which resulted, was due to the wars and
the progress of French arms, and directly attributes
it to the depreciation of the French specie, and to
their quite deliberate departure from the standard of
French coinage as fixed in 1726.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SOUTH GERMAN AND PRUSSIAN SYSTEMS</i></div>

<p>In Prussia the reform of the coinage system was <!-- Page 203 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
undertaken by her first King, Frederick <span class="smcap">I.</span>, father of
Frederick the Great. In 1750 the latter adopted the
14-thaler or 21-gulden standard, subdividing the
thaler into 24 groschens of 12 pfennige each. The
measure was undertaken expressly to stop the export of
gold which was going on. The adoption of a standard
lower than the Convention standard effectually prevented
the outflow of Prussian money, and it was not
until the beginning of the present century, through
the new Mint confusion which arose from the French
Revolution, that Prussian money spread into Saxony,
Hanover, Hesse, and even into the south-west. The
second idea of Frederick's reform was to buy gold
cheap, but in this it did not succeed. The intention
was to obtain for five Prussian thalers the gold
<i>pistoles</i>, which were purchasable for five convention
thalers. This rate, however, never prevailed in the
market, as from the first the <i>pistole</i> was valued
at 5 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> Prussian thalers. During the Seven Years
War, when Frederick was driven to a depreciation of
his coinage, his system went to pieces. But an
active reform was undertaken upon the conclusion of
the peace of Hubertsburg, 1763. The 14-thaler
system was re-established, although, as far as the
smaller divisional silver coinage was concerned, the
depreciation, in which Frederick had been imitated by
the pettier states round him, continued into the present
century.</p>

<p>In 1821 a minor alteration was made in the
Prussian system, by subdividing the thaler into 30 <!-- Page 204 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
instead of as previously 24 groschen, the former being
distinguished from the latter by the title of <i>silver
groschen</i>. To this Prussian or 14-thaler system
Saxony acceded, as did also, in 1848, Mecklenburg and
Oldenburg, with many minor differences of detail,&mdash;Saxony,
for example, dividing the silver groschen
into 10 pfennige; Mecklenburg dividing the thaler
into 48 schillings of 12 pfennige each; and Oldenburg
dividing it into 72 grotens of 5 schwarens each.
The gold coin was supplied by the Prussian and
Hanoverian 5 and 10-thaler pieces, the Friedrichs
<i>d'or</i>, a favourite trade coin even in South Germany,
and by Spanish <i>pistoles</i> circulating at an equivalence
of 4 6-livre thalers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CONFERENCE OF MUNICH, 1837</i></div>

<p>The confusion of these various German systems
was further increased by the uncertainty and difference
which had come to prevail in the unit of weight.
In Austria alone there were 2 marks in use, the
Vienna mark (= 288.644 grs.), and the Cologne
mark (= 243.870 grs.). While in North Germany,
and subsequently in the south-west, the Prussian
mark (= 233.855 grs.) prevailed. It was as the
outcome of a desire to remedy at once the evil
condition and confusion of the currency, and the
uncertainty as to weight standard, which led to the
conference of Munich on 25th August 1837. At that
conference, Bavaria, Würtemberg, Baden, Hesse,
Darmstadt, and the Free State of Frankfort, adopted
the 24 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-gulden standard as the standard for their
several states. At the same time the Prussian mark <!-- Page 205 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
(233.855 grms. = half the Prussian pound), was established
as the Mint mark for the contracting members.
For the divisional coinage (6 and 3-kreutzer pieces) a
standard of 27 guldens to the mark was adopted, the
details of the various fractional pieces being left to
the different states. To this convention Hesse,
Hamburg, and the two Hohenzollerns acceded in
the following years.</p>

<p>This movement of South Germany gave a new
impetus to the idea of Mint unification, and led to the
General Mint Convention of the States of the Zollverein,
agreed upon in full assembly of delegates
at Dresden, 30th July 1838, and ratified also at
Dresden on the 7th January 1839. The Dresden
Convention was practically the first renewed attempt
at Mint unification which Germany had seen since
1738. The contracting members to this general Mint
convention were Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Würtemburg,
Baden, Hesse, Saxe-Weimar, Eisenach, Saxe-Meiningen,
Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg and Gotha,
Nassau, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen,
Reuss, Reuss-Schleiz, Reuss-Lobenstein,
Ebersdorf, and Frankfurt.</p>

<p>Briefly, the articles of the convention were as
follow:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. The Mint mark of all these contracting states
of the Customs Union shall be the Prussian Mint
mark = 233.855 grms.</p>

<p>"2. On this common weight standard the coinages
of the contracting states shall be in accordance with <!-- Page 206 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
the two systems in existence among the said states, viz.
by thalers and groschen, according to the 14-thaler (or
Prussian) system; or by gulden and kreutzer, according
to the 24 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-gulden (or South German) standard.
For the purpose of assimilation or equivalating, the
thaler to be reckoned = 1 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-gulden, and the gulden =
 <span class="above">4</span>&#8260;<span class="below">7</span>-thaler.</p>

<p>"3. The 14-thaler system to be that of Prussian
Saxony, Hesse, Saxony, and Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg
and Gotha (Gotha), <span class="correction" title="corrected from 'Schwanzburg'">Schwarzburg</span>-Rudolstadt
(Unterherrschaft), Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, and
Reuss; the 24 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-gulden system to prevail in Bavaria,
Würtemberg, Baden, Hesse, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Coburg
and Gotha (Coburg), Nassau, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt
(Oberherrschaft), and the Free State of
Frankfurt.</p>

<p>"4. Each state will confine its mintings to such
pieces as prevail in the system of which it forms part.</p>

<p>"5. In larger specie, and also in divisional coin,
each state to bind itself to exercise the greatest care
to preserve the standard and weight.</p>

<p>"7. For the purpose of the commerce of the
contracting states <i>union</i> or <i>convention</i> coins (<i>vereinsmünze</i>)
shall be minted seven to the mark of fine
silver, at an equivalence of 2 thalers or 3 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> guldens,
fully tenderable throughout the Union.</p>

<p>"8. Alloy to be .9 silver, .1 copper; so that 6 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">10</span>
pieces = 1 Mint mark in weight; remedy = .003.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DRESDEN CONVENTION, 1838</i></div>

<p>"9. From 1st January 1839 to 1842, at least
2,000,000 of these <i>vereinsmünze</i> to be coined, one-third <!-- Page 207 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> value except
part each year, and by the various states <i>pro
rata</i> of their population. From 1842 onwards, in
case of no new treaty, the rate of minting to be two
millions <i>vereinsmünze</i> every four years, <i>pro rata</i> as
before; each state to give an account of its mintings<span class="correction" title="corrected from ','">.</span></p>

<p>"10. Also of their separate trials of standard and
weight.</p>

<p>"11, 13. None of the contracting states to set its
particular internal specie at any different
on a three months' notice, and to renew its currency
at face value in case of depreciation.</p>

<p>"12. The states bind themselves not to issue
divisional coins in excess of such <i>pro rata</i> requirements
as above.</p>

<p>"14. For the divisional coinage the standard of
the convention of Munich, 1837 (viz. 27 gulden), is
adopted.</p>

<p>"18. The treaty to endure till the end of 1858.
States intending to retire then to give two years'
notice. From that date, if not discarded, the treaty to
be periodically renewed (five-yearly)."</p>

<p>This treaty continued in force nominally until the
later and still more famous convention of Vienna in
1857, before which date Hanover, Brunswick, and
Oldenburg had also given in their adherence to it.</p>

<p>At the time of the Mint Conference and Convention
of Vienna, therefore, there were, broadly speaking,
three competing systems in Germany, viz. of Austria,
Prussia, and South Germany or Bavaria.</p>

<p>One aspect of this latter conference of 1857, viz. <!-- Page 208 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
its deliberations with regard to gold coinage, will
be referred to separately. As far as relates to its
attempted systematisation of these three German currencies
the agreement took the following form:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The pound of 500 grammes decimally subdivided,
to be used as the basis of the coinage.</p>

<p>2. The competing systems to be assimilated to
this basis by the following regulation:&mdash;</p>

<p>The thaler (or Prussian) standard of 30 thalers to
the pound of silver to take the place of the 14-thaler
standard, and to prevail in Prussia, Saxony, Hanover,
Hesse, and a string of minor states.</p>

<p>The Austrian standard to be on the basis of 45
guldens out of a pound of fine silver, and to prevail
in the Empire of Austria and the principality of
Lichtenstein.</p>

<p>The South German standard to be on the basis of
52 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-gulden to the pound of silver (instead of the
24 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-florin standard formerly used), and to prevail in
Bavaria, Würtemburg, Baden, Hesse, Frankfurt, and
a few other places of South Germany.</p>

<p>The equivalence of the systems was to be&mdash;</p>

<p>One-thaler convention piece ( <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">30</span> pound) = 1 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> florins
in Austrian currency = 1 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> florin in South German
currency.</p>

<p>All the coins to be of unlimited validity in all the
states, divisional coinage to be of a lighter standard
than the coinage standard of the country, but lighter
only within limits fixed. The tender of these latter
to be limited to 20-thaler or 40-gulden. <!-- Page 209 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE VIENNA CONFERENCE, 1857</i></div>

<p>The regulations adopted by this Vienna Convention
as to the gold coinage are very significant, and
deserve special note.</p>

<p>The advance in the gold price of silver, due to
the Californian and San Franciscan gold finds, acted
on the silver-using countries. As soon as the price of
bar silver exceeded 60 <span class="above">7</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>-pence per standard oz., there
resulted a melting down and export of the silver, in
the countries which had adopted bimetallism at the
15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-ratio.</p>

<p>It was this experience in France, and the allied
group of countries, which led to the formation of the
Latin Union in 1865. In mere point of date, that
union had been preceded by the Vienna Conference
and Convention by a matter of eight years. And as
far as the regulations of this latter relating to gold
coinage are concerned, there is evidence that the
bimetallic action of France had driven Germany to
her union of 1857, as a mere matter of self-defence,
just as it later drove the Latin states to their union
of 1865. In both cases the underlying motive was a
wish to protect that part of their currency system
which was threatened by bimetallic law. The
premium on gold, on its minting, <i>i.e.</i> the profit
to be made on minting it at 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> in France, while its
market value was considerably less in Germany and
elsewhere, drew the gold to France. It is a mistake
to think that France attracted gold simply from
California and Australia. She attracted it by the
action of bimetallic law from her neighbour Germany, <!-- Page 210 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
and replaced it by 5-franc silver mintings. The
circulation of French 5-franc pieces was so extensive
in South Germany, in the period preceding the
Vienna Convention, that the cash reserve of the
Frankfort bank was at one moment composed almost
entirely of them.</p>

<p>The manner in which the Vienna Convention met
the difficulty has the appearance of plausibility,
though it proved in the end ineffectual. It determined
not to establish a fixed ratio but to follow the
market price of gold, apparently in the hope of
attracting a natural or market supply.</p>

<p>"For the purpose of further facilitating mutual
transactions, and for the promotion of trade with
neighbouring countries, the contracting powers may
coin convention trade coins in gold, under the names
<i>crown</i>, and <i>half-crown</i>.</p>

<p>"1. The crown =  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">50</span> of a pound of fine silver.</p>

<p>"2. The half-crown =  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">100</span>.</p>

<p>"The contracting powers may not coin any other
gold piece, except Austria, which retains the right of
coining <i>ducats</i> of the present value, to the end of 1865.</p>

<p>"The silver value of the convention gold coins in
ordinary intercourse is entirely fixed by the relation
of the supply to the demand. They must not, therefore,
be considered as a medium of payment of the
same nature as the legal silver currency of the
country, and no one is legally bound to receive them
as such.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE VIENNA CONVENTION, 1857</i></div>

<p>"Each state is at liberty to permit convention gold <!-- Page 211 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
coins to be paid into their offices instead of silver,
according to a previously settled fixed rate, and to
extend this permission either to all transactions and
offices, or only to some. Such previous settlement
of the rate is, however, never to last more than six
months, and must at the expiration of the last month
always be renewed for the following official treasury
period of exchange. The rate cannot be fixed at a
higher value than that given to such coinage by the
average of the official commercial rate of exchange
during the previous six months. Each government
also reserves to itself the right to alter the rate at
any time within the period fixed, and to suspend it

<p>"5. The declaration that such rate of exchange
only affects payments to be made into offices of the
state.</p>

<p>"In the countries of the contracting powers pay-offices
of the State, as well as public institutions,
banks, etc., shall not be allowed in future, in payments
to be made by them, to make any proviso with
regard to the medium of payment in silver or gold, in
such a way that for the latter a certain fixed relative
value should be expressed beforehand in silver
money."</p>

<p>From the point of view of Austria, this convention
had been entered upon with the desire of effecting a
gradual adoption of gold coinage, together with a
concurrent ceasing of the compulsory note circulation.
The outcome of the conference was, however,
in quite distinct opposition to this desire, as the
agreement which was finally arrived at established
the maintenance of a pure silver currency. The
continuance of the gold <i>crown</i> of 10-grs. fine gold
was recognised only as a trade medium. This
experiment of a trade gold coin failed completely,
though it is none the less interesting intrinsically, as
well as for its reflex bearing on the similar schemes
which were proposed in the early years of the French
Revolution. The premium on the minting of gold
drew it to France, in preference to any other place
where a simple market price prevailed. And the
20-franc gold pieces of France overflowed, while the
German crowns could not struggle into existence. <!-- Page 213 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GERMANY: ATTEMPTS AT REFORM, 1860-70</i></div>

<p>The attempt which was made by a commercial
conference at Hamburg, at the time of the meeting of
the Vienna Conference, to secure the introduction by
the Hamburg Bank of a gold instead of a silver <i>valuta</i>,
remained equally ineffectual.</p>

<p>As far as concerns the establishment of a simple
and single monetary system for Germany was concerned,
this Vienna Convention, the last great
convention which Germany saw previous to the
reconstruction of her system in 1871, was as futile
as that of Dresden in 1838, or as all the conventions
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
previously.</p>

<p>The consciousness of the need of such simplification
and unification, however, became thereby only the
more apparent. Four years later the first German
Handelstag, which met in May 1861 at Heidelberg,
turned its first and special attention to the erection of
some common currency system. The recommendation
which it finally concluded upon was the adoption
of the <i>Drittelthaler</i> as the unit mark, with a decimal
subdivision. Four years later the third Handelstag,
which met at Frankfort (September 1865), confirmed
the resolution, with the additional proposition of the
minting of a gold piece identical with the 20-franc
piece, the value of which should be regulated from
time to time; the scheme being, therefore, as before,
that of a silver standard, with gold as trade money.
The fourth Handelstag met at Berlin in October
1868, and again the matter was most seriously discussed. <!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
With the single exception of the Berlin
members, all the deputies declared for the adoption of
the gold standard. As, in the preceding year, Austria
had withdrawn from the German Monetary Union of
1857, she no longer stood in the way of this proposition,
and the erection of the North German Union
distinctly favoured the project.</p>

<p>In June 1870 the Bundesrath of the North German
Union resolved upon a reform and unification of
the paper money, as preparatory to a complete currency
reform, and in the same month the Chancellor of the
North German Union had decided to call a Mint
Convention. The outbreak of the Franco-German
War immediately afterwards put a short stop to the
proposal.</p>

<p>A long train of preparation had thus been laid,
and there can be little doubt as to what the ultimate
direction of German monetary legislation would have
been, even without the war, and the consequent erection
of the Empire. That the latter event, however,
enormously facilitated the process cannot for a moment
be questioned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GERMANY: NEW IMPERIAL SYSTEM, 1871</i></div>

<p>When the subject was taken up after the Franco-German
War, the determination to adopt a gold
coinage was only gradually arrived at. In the original
plan, as drafted soon after the conclusion of peace,
the new gold coinage proposed was intended not to
be tenderable, for the meantime, in private commerce.
Such a provision roused all the opposition of the
mercantile community, and in consequence of the <!-- Page 215 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
agitation the scheme, as finally submitted to the
Reichstag, was for a gold monometallic system.
The law passed on the 4th December 1871, and
the great operation of recoinage and conversion was
immediately entered upon. It was greatly favoured
by the ratio existing at the moment, and by the
metallic condition of the world. The ratio taken
as the basis of the computation was the French
15.5, accepted because of its long and present wide
employment.</p>

<p>The previous silver standard thalers were taken as
equivalent to 3 marks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
30 thaler = 90 mark = 1 pound fine silver.<br />
90 × 15.5 = 1395 marks.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The gold piece of 10 marks was therefore coined
at a tale of 139 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> to the pound of fine gold.</p>

<p>Propositions were made to the Reichstag that the
20-franc piece should be made equivalent to the English
sovereign, or to the 25-franc piece, giving respectively
a ratio of 15.17 or 15.31, but at the moment
the price of silver in the London market ruled between
60 <span class="above">7</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> and 60 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> pence per ounce, <i>i.e.</i> at a mercantile ratio
of 15.49-15.52. It was this fact which decided the
adoption of the French ratio.</p>

<p>The chief Acts which have accomplished the
reform are of dates 5th December 1871 and 9th July
1873, the first declaring the monetary system and the

<p>The unit of the system is the mark, which is the
 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">1255</span>.5 part of a pound of gold of 500 grammes at  <span class="above">9</span>&#8260;<span class="below">10</span> <!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
fine, and is coined into pieces of 20 and 10 marks.
The gold crown is a 10-mark piece, is  <span class="above">9</span>&#8260;<span class="below">10</span> fine, and
struck at a tale of 139 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> pieces to the German
pound; charge for coinage, 3 marks per pound of
fine gold.</p>

<p>The pound of fine silver is struck into 100 marks,
 <span class="above">9</span>&#8260;<span class="below">10</span> fine. The total amount of silver coin not to exceed
10 marks per head of population. No individual need
accept more than 20 marks of imperial silver coin in
payments. They are accepted in any amount by the
Empire and by the Federal States.</p>

<p>All other German coins are no longer legal tender,
and have been withdrawn, with the single exception
of the thaler pieces. Whatever pieces of this kind
still exist are legal tender to any amount, like the
imperial gold coins, each being equal to 3 marks. An
Act of 20th April 1870 provides that <i>Vereinsthalers</i>
coined in Austria before 1867 should also be full legal
tender. An Act of 6th January 1876 has authorised
the Bundesrath to put the thaler pieces and the
Austrian <i>Vereinsthalers</i> on the same footing as
imperial silver coins, <i>i.e.</i> to make them legal tender
only up to 20 marks, the thaler being still reckoned
at 3 marks. Since the suspension of silver sales and
of the withdrawal of the silver thalers (May 1879)
there is no likelihood that the Bundesrath will make
use of this authority conferred upon it.</p>

<p>In briefest résumé, the course of the silver coinage
during the preceding century may be presented

<p>Of this amount 382,684,841 marks were delivered

<h5>England<span class="correction" title="period added">.</span></h5>

<p>Charles <span class="smcap">II.</span> began his regulation of the currency
by the proclamation of 29th January 1661, fixing the
coins to be current and their tariff. This proclamation
was followed by another, of 10th June 1661, against <!-- Page 220 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
the export of gold or silver, and against buying or
selling the metals at higher rates than were given at the
Mint, a practice to which the proclamation attributed
the scarcity of money. This edict proved of no
avail, for, in spite of it, the gold coins were exported
in such quantities that they were current more
abundantly in foreign parts than in England. As the
result of deliberation of the Privy Council, assisted
by the Commissioners of Trade and officers of the
Mint, who all attributed the export to the higher
price of gold abroad, it was determined to raise the
price of the gold coins to or near the value which
they had on the Continent at the moment. Accordingly,
by proclamation of the 26th August 1661, the
value of the gold <i>unite</i> was raised from 22s. to
23s. 6d., and other gold coins in proportion, the
silver currency being left unaltered.</p>

<p>In referring to the Act for the free trade in gold
and silver (<i>supra</i>, p. <a href="#Page_162">162</a>), mention has already been
made of the motive of the legislator, namely, to
increase the importation of the metals to the Mint.
Exactly similar was the intention, as expressed in the
preamble of the succeeding Act of 1666 (8 Charles
<span class="smcap">II.</span> c. 5), which abolished the right of seigniorage,
thereby establishing free and gratuitous coinage in
England&mdash;the principle of minting still in force in
this country.<a name="FNanchor_17_21" id="FNanchor_17_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_21" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND: CHARLES II</i></div>

<p><!-- Page 221 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
The testimony of both Act and declaration as to
the scarcity of money is confirmed by actual record.
In the following year, 1667, there was a great scarcity
of money, and <i>dollars</i> and <i>pieces of eight</i> were bought
up by the goldsmiths and bankers for 4s. 3d. each,
and instead of being brought to the Mint were at
once exported to France for 4s. 10d. and to Ireland
and Scotland for 5s.</p>

<p>According to the new indenture for the coinage of
1670, a slight reduction in the standard of the gold
took place, the pound of crown gold (22 carats fine)
being to be minted at a tale of £44, 10s. The
scarcity of money still continued, however, and the
separate experience of Ireland only corroborated that
of England. The general statement of the case as
to the fate of the coined money since the Act of
18 Car <span class="smcap">II.</span>, which instituted free coinage, is thus put
by Sir Dudley North, in his <i>Discourses upon Trade</i>:
"I call to witness the vast sums that have been
coined in England since the free coinage was set up.
What is become of it all? Nobody believes it to be
in the nation, and it cannot well be all transported,
the penalties for so doing being so great. The case
is plain&mdash;the melting-pot devours it all; and I know
no intelligent man who doubts but the new money
goes this way. Silver and gold, like other commodities,
have their ebbings and flowings; upon the
arrival of quantities from Spain, the Mint commonly
gives the best price, <i>i.e.</i> coined silver for uncoined
silver, weight for weight. Wherefore it is carried <!-- Page 222 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
into the Tower and coined. Not long after there
will come a demand for bullion to be exported again.
If there is none, but all happens to be in coin, what
then? Melt it down again; there's no loss in it, for
the coining costs the coiners nothing. Thus the
nation hath been abused and made to pay for the
twisting of straw for asses to eat."</p>

<p>By the time of the accession of William <span class="smcap">III.</span> the
scarcity of silver had become so great as to cause a
petition from divers working goldsmiths in and about
the City of London to the House of Commons (9th
April 1690). It stated "that upon search at the
Customs they found that since last October entries
had been made of 286,102 oz. of silver in bullion,
and 89,949 <i>dollars</i> and <i>pieces of eight</i> for exportation
by divers private persons, and they doubted not
but it would appear that not only the East India
Company, but also divers Jews and merchants, had of
late bought up great quantities of silver to carry out
of the kingdom, and had given 1 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>d. per oz. above the
value, which had encouraged the melting down of
much plate and milled monies; whereby for six
months past, not only the petitioners in their trade,
but the Mint itself had been stopped from coining."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND: THE EXPORT IN 1690</i></div>

<p>The petition was referred to a committee of the
Lower House, which reported on the 8th May that
great quantities of silver had been exported, of which
seven-eighths had been shipped off by the Jews, who
would do anything for their profit. The reason for
the exportation, too, was plain, for the French <!-- Page 223 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
king, of late finding his money very scarce, had
raised his coin 10 per cent., which was an encouragement
to send silver to fill his coffers, and therefore the
Jews exported it daily in very great quantities. The
melting down of £1000 of milled money for exportation
was attended with a profit of £25 ready money
and upwards, silver being coined at the Mint at
5s. 2d. per oz., but at the time of exportation sold
generally at 5s. 3 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>d. The remedies proposed to the
committee were either a prohibition of export or the
enhancing of the English monies.</p>

<p>Not less than three measures were presented to
the House for the prohibition of export&mdash;one of them
by Sir Richard Temple&mdash;but were all lost; and, meanwhile,
the exports to Holland and France continued.
In November 1690 it was calculated that during the
preceding sixteen months about 140,000 oz. had been
exported.</p>

<p>In addition to this actual drain of coinage, the
processes of culling, clipping, and counterfeiting,
which had been going on through the reigns of
Charles <span class="smcap">II.</span> and James <span class="smcap">II.</span>, had resulted in an
unexampled depreciation of so much of the coinage
as remained. A large portion of the currency consisted
of iron, brass, or copper-pieces plated, and
such coins as were of good silver were worth scarcely
one-half their current value.</p>

<p>This statement is more than borne out by quite
reliable computations which were made in the process
of the recoinage five years later. A medium lot of <!-- Page 224 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
5 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> bags, containing in tale £57,200 of the called-in
currency, and which should have weighed 221,418 oz.
16 dwt. 8 grs., was found to weigh only 113,771 oz.
5 dwt. According to the accounts of Neale, then
master and warden of the Mint, 4,695,303 dwt. 15 oz.
2 grs. of the clipped silver money produced only
790,860 lbs. 1 oz. 19 grs., implying a depreciation in
weight alone of over 47.75 per cent.</p>

<p>The process of stripping the country of currency
was increased by the continual pouring out of money
in aid of William's wars, and the loss in exchange on
such large remittances made the evil only too apparent.
The one or two millions yearly remitted to
the Continent for the British armies were negotiated
in Holland in a thousand ways to England's prejudice.
Partisan statements were made that whereas in the
beginning of the war the Dutch allowed 43 schillings
for an English pound they gradually lowered the
exchange to 28 schillings. Guineas, which were equal
in value to 21s. 6d. in silver, rose to 30s.; and they
would have risen to a still higher rate if the officers
of the exchequer and the receivers of public revenue
had not refused to receive them in payment at the
increased value.</p>

<p>In 1695 the matter was taken up in the House of
Commons, and a committee appointed. The report
of this committee, which was never passed, was based
on the proposition of a reduction of standard. By
Montague's influence the proposals were dropped,
and it was not till the 22nd November that the Act <!-- Page 225 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
for remedying the ill state of the coins passed.
It is well known that the unwise determination of the
Government of William <span class="smcap">III.</span> to adhere to the pre-existing
standard was due to the action and contrivance
of Montague as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and to
the influence of Locke's writings. By a subsequent
series of Acts, based on the complaints of merchants
representing the evils resulting from the unsettled
price of gold, the price of the guinea was ordered to
be gradually reduced from 30s. to 28s., 26s., and
finally 22s., before 10th April 1696.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENGLAND: RECOINAGE OF 1696</div>

<p>This great recoinage scheme was only completely
accomplished in 1699, having occupied the greater
part of four years, and after a long series of Acts and
proclamations of, occasionally, very doubtful wisdom.</p>

<p>According to the accounts of the officers of the
Mint, the new silver coin amounted in tale to
£6,882,908, 19s. 7d. The worn and clipped money
called in was estimated roughly at £4,000,000, on
which the loss was about £2,000,000; the whole
charge and loss being stated at not less than
£2,700,000. It is significantly affirmed that, in a
manner, all the called-in silver was found to consist
only of pieces coined between the days of Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span>
and 1662, a sure indication of the fate which had
befallen the coinage issued since the Restoration.</p>

<p>Before the transaction was finally complete the
last safeguard and complement of the system had
been adopted, in fixing the relation of the gold coinage
to the new silver issue. On the 22nd September <!-- Page 226 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
1698, a report was given in to the House of Commons,
signed by four names, including that of John
Locke, stating that the value of gold in Holland
and the neighbouring countries was, as near as could
be computed upon a medium, 15:1 in silver; and
that, according to this value, the currency of the guinea
at 22s. was too high, and occasioned a disproportionate
importation of gold and an exportation of silver.
The bringing down of the guinea to 21s. 6d. would
make the value of English gold and coin very near
15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>:1 to silver, which, though not so low as the
rate in Holland, would in their opinion be sufficient to
correct the error.</p>

<p>In consequence of this report the Commons resolved
that, under the Act 7 and 8 William <span class="smcap">III.</span> chap.
19, no person was obliged to take guineas at 22s. a
piece. The price then fell to 21s. 6d., at which rate
they were received by the officers of the revenue.
With the exception of this merely declaratory tariffing
of the guinea, it is to be borne in mind that this
recoinage of William's reign was carried out on the
principle enunciated by Montague, and backed by the
authority of Locke, namely, that of a retention of the
old standard, although in the face of a clearly established
advance in the value of silver, and in face of
quite irrefutable answers to all Locke's arguments.
Momentarily the scheme succeeded; the adverse exchange
was instantly redressed, while the renewal of
the coinage and the ratio of 1698 was sufficiently
above the continual ratio to turn the flow of gold, as <!-- Page 227 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
doubtless was the (unexpressed) design in adopting
it. According to Burnet the packet-boat from France
seldom came over during the following winter without
bringing 10,000 <i>louis d'or</i>, and often more. "The
nation was indeed filled with them, and in six months
a million of guineas was coined out of them. The
merchants in fact said that the balance of trade was
then so much turned to our side that whereas we
were wont to carry over a million of our money in
specie, we then sent no money to France, and had at
least half that sum sent over to balance the trade."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENGLAND: EFFECTS OF THE RATIO OF 1698</div>

<p>The circulation of French and other foreign gold
became so great that on the 5th February 1701 the
Council issued a proclamation that the <i>louis d'or</i> and
Spanish <i>pistole</i> should not pass for above 17s. Such
action at once brought those coins to the Mint, and
nearly 1 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> millions were coined out of them.</p>

<p>It was not seen at the moment that the establishment
of this ratio so favourable to gold was <i>pari passu</i>
unfavourable to silver. The idea was entertained
that the French gold came over to bribe English
members, <i>i.e.</i>, on mere political causes. The hypothesis
was needless as it was incorrect. Gold came
over because it was higher priced in England than
abroad through the ratio of 1698, and for the same
reason silver left the country to pay for the gold.
The one movement was the essential counterpart of
the other, and made itself at last only too visible.</p>

<p>As early as the seventh year of Anne's reign&mdash;only
nine years after the completion of this great recoinage, <!-- Page 228 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
it was found necessary to give further encouragement
to the coinage of silver by offering a premium on
every ounce of foreign coins which should be brought
to the Mint within a limited time. The premium was
not to exceed 2 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>d. per oz., and the time limited was
from the 17th April to the 1st December 1709.</p>

<p>Such a measure has been already noticed in the
history of France; it was indeed a design frequently
employed there under the title of <i>Surachat</i>, and it
always proved as futile as the Government of Anne
found it to be. As the drain continued, representations
were made by the officers of the Mint to the
Treasury, and in 1717 the House of Commons requested
these representations to be laid before it
(December 20th). On the same and following day
a remarkable speech was made by a member, Mr.
Aislabie, who took notice of the great scarcity of the
silver species, and proposed the remedy of lowering
the gold species. On the second day he was
seconded by Mr. Caswall, who suggested that the
overvaluation of gold in the current coins of Great
Britain had caused the export of great quantities of
silver species, "and to that purpose [<i>i.e.</i> the purpose
of his argument] laid open a clandestine trade, which
of late years had been carried on by the Dutch,
Hamburgers and other foreigners, in concert with
the Jews and other traders here, which consisted in
exporting silver coins and importing gold in lieu
thereof; which being coined into guineas at the
Tower, near 15 pence was got by every guinea, <!-- Page 229 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
which amounted to about 5 per cent.; and as these
returns might be made five or six times in a year
considerable sums were got by it, to the prejudice
of Great Britain, which thereby was drained of silver
and overstocked with gold." He concluded by proposing
to lower the price of guineas and all other
gold specie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENGLAND: SIR ISAAC NEWTON'S REPORT, 1717</div>

<p>His speech was received with applause, and the
House unanimously petitioned the King to call the
guinea down to 21s., and other gold species in proportion.
To this George <span class="smcap">I.</span> immediately acceded,
and the proclamation to that effect <i>verbatim</i> was
issued on the following day, 22nd December 1717.</p>

<p>The report for which the House had called two
days earlier, and which was produced on the 21st
December, was the celebrated report made some
months before by Sir Isaac Newton as master of the
Mint, at the demand of the Commissioners of the
Treasury. It is a document deserving the careful
attention of every student of currency history.
Newton reviews the ratio in each of the then
commercial nations, and shows the effect of difference
of ratio in producing export and disturbance of
one or other metal. "Gold in Spain and Portugal
is of sixteen times more value than silver of equal
weight and alloy; at which rate a guinea is worth
21s. 1d. net; this high price keeps their gold at
home in good plenty, and carries away the Spanish
silver into all Europe. So that at home they
make their payments in gold, and will not pay in <!-- Page 230 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
silver without a premium. Upon the coming in of a
plate [silver] fleet the premium ceases or is but small,
but as their silver goes away and becomes scarce the
premium increases and is most commonly about six
per cent."</p>

<p>In France the ratio was 15:1, and the guinea
therefore worth 20s. 8 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>d. In Holland it was worth
20s. 7 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>d., in Italy, Germany, Poland, Denmark
and Sweden, from 20s. 7d. to 20s. 4d. "In China
and Japan the pound weight of fine gold is worth
but 9 or 10 lbs. weight of fine silver, and in East
India it may be worth 12 lbs., and the low price
of gold in proportion to silver carries away the
silver from all Europe." "If gold were lowered
only so as to have the same proportion to the
silver money in England, which it hath in the rest
of Europe, there would be no temptation to export
silver rather than gold to any part of Europe,
and to compass this last there seems nothing more
requisite than to take off about 10d. or 12d. from the
guinea."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENGLAND: THE STATE OF COINAGE IN 1760</div>

<p>In a subsequent report of the 21st September
1717, Newton stated that, since the beginning of 1702
to September 1717, the gold coined at the Mint
amounted to £7,127,835, while the silver within the
same period only amounted to £223,380, of which
£143,086 had been brought to the Mint in response
to the premium offered; in 1709 and 1711, of their own
free will, the goldsmiths had only brought a matter of
£21,220 to the Mint. In the House of Lords, early <!-- Page 231 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
in the following year, it was proved that during the
year 1717 the East India Company had exported
nearly 3,000,000 oz. of silver.</p>

<p>The immediate purpose of the above proclamation
of 22nd December 1717 was for a time
thwarted by a speculative hoarding of silver in
expectation of a further calling down of the gold
species; and it was to cut the ground from under
this speculation that in January 1718 both Houses
declared their determination not to alter the standard
of gold and silver coins in the kingdom, and proceeded
in place of such alteration to prepare a bill for
preventing the melting down of the coins of the
kingdom.</p>

<p>It is demonstrable, even from Sir Isaac Newton's
own figures, that the calling down of the guinea to
21s., though largely, was not completely effective in
destroying the profit of arbitrage transactions with
Holland. With the guinea at 21s., the ratio was
still 15 <span class="above">14295</span>&#8260;<span class="below">68200</span> while in France and Holland the ratio
was 15 or under. That the process of culling and
exporting the heaviest silver specie still continued is
proved by the state of silver coinage twenty years
later, when shillings were found to be deficient in
weight, by between 6 and 11 per cent., and sixpences
between 11 and 22 per cent., and all species so scarce
as to threaten greatest confusion in every branch of
trade. At the accession of George III., 1760, the
silver coinage was found in so imperfect a state that
the crown pieces had almost entirely disappeared, <!-- Page 232 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
though minted since 1795 to the amount of over a
million and a half sterling. Of half-crowns, likewise
minted to the value of £2,329,370, only defaced and
impaired specimens remained current, while shillings
and sixpences had lost every sign of impression.
Up to 1763 only a matter of £5791 in silver had
issued from the Mint&mdash;practically no coinage at all.</p>

<p>Gradually however, owing to the force of wider
principles at work, the matter of the ratio righted
itself. Ever since 1756 the value of gold had been
rising all over Europe. In 1759 the continental ratio
was still calculated at 14 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>, as compared with 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">5</span> in
England; but by 1773 the continental ratio had
overtaken the English, and the market price of
standard silver had risen to 5s. 2d. per oz.&mdash;the
English Mint rate. In the greatly depreciated state
of the silver coinage&mdash;three-fourths of it was said to
be base&mdash;even the approach of a fair ratio acted
prejudicially on gold. Already, in 1771, the export of
gold to Holland had become noticed, and it was
asserted that the gold coins had never before been so
deficient. They were sent over to Holland, and there
filed and returned and put into circulation&mdash;a bimetallic
phenomenon that always recurs in a currency
containing two differently depreciated elements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENGLAND: STATE OF THE COINAGE IN 1774</div>

<p>The idea that bimetallic action replaces one good
metal by another, an equal weight of one metal for
that of the other, a good undepreciated coinage of
silver for a good undepreciated coinage of gold, or
<i>vice versâ</i>, is not borne out by a single instance in <!-- Page 233 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
history. Bimetallic action always substitutes the less
for the greater, whether weight or value, the more
depreciated for the less, or the depreciated for the
perfect standard coin. In this particular instance,
1774, the depreciation of silver had been the result of
the action of a too high ratio from 1717 onwards; the
depreciation of gold was effected in a much less time
between 1770 and 1773, simply because the already
depreciated state of the silver causing that differentiation
of value, which is the bullionist's opportunity,
happened to coincide with a natural rise of the value
of gold all over the Continent. The result, therefore,
of fifty years of bimetallic régime left England with a
currency depreciated in both its limbs, in both gold
and silver, and as deficient in the quantity current as
in the weight of the individual pieces. This is not in
keeping with the theory of bimetallism as developed
to-day, according to which the transition from one
coin to the other would only be made at the point of
equation, and the substituted metal would equalise
that displaced. This is theory. The facts of the
situation in 1774 are not theory but history, and tell
a different tale.</p>

<p>"The evil was so great," says Lord Liverpool,
"that the Government found it necessary to take this
difficult subject into their immediate consideration.
On this <span class="correction" title="corrected from 'occassion'">occasion</span> I addressed a letter to a noble Lord,
who was then Chancellor of the Exchequer, suggesting
what appeared to me the proper remedy for this
evil. I proposed that, with a view to the general <!-- Page 234 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
reform of the coins of the realm, all the deficient gold
coins should in the first place be called in and
recoined, and that in future the currency of the gold
coin should be regulated by weight as well as by tale,
and that the several pieces should not be legal tender
if diminished below a certain weight. Your Majesty
was pleased to approve of this advice and to propose
to your Parliament, on 13th January 1774, the calling
in and recoining of all the deficient gold coins; and
the Chancellor of your Exchequer opened the whole of
this plan to the House of Commons, who approved
of the measure, which was carried into immediate
execution without any complaint and with great
success. The defects which had previously existed in
this species of coins were thereby removed, and the
regulation, then established, of weighing the gold coin
has been the means of preserving it at nearly the
state of perfection to which it was then brought."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENGLAND: RECOINAGE OF 1774</div>

<p>The resolutions of the House of Commons on
which this recoinage depended were passed on the
10th May 1774. After stating the depreciation
existing in the gold coinage the House asserted&mdash;(3)
that it has been a practice to export and melt down
the new and perfect gold coin soon after it is issued
for private advantage, to the great detriment of
England; (4) that while pieces of gold coin, differing
so greatly in weight, are allowed to be current under
the same denomination and at the same rate and
value, great quantities of the new
will continue to be exported and melted down, and, <!-- Page 235 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> and perfect pieces
there is reason to apprehend, will be recoined into
pieces the most deficient that are allowed to be
current."</p>

<p>The House then goes on to adopt the principle of
limiting the depreciation to be allowed on any single
coin, <i>i.e.</i> of making the coins current by weight as
well as tale within the limits allowed.</p>

<p>The House next turned its attention to the silver
element of the currency. At the outset it was met
by the patent fact that the depreciated silver coinage
had been made the handle or lever, or <i>point
d'avantage</i>, in all the operations against gold.
"Whereas," is the recital of the Act of 14 George III.
c. 42, "considerable quantities of old silver coin of this
realm, or coin purporting to be such, greatly below the
standard of the Mint in weight, have been lately
imported into this kingdom, and it is expedient that
some provision should be made to prevent the
practice," etc. The Act therefore decrees the prohibition
of importation of light silver coinage into the
kingdom, and its confiscation in case of discovery as
such. "And be it further enacted ... that no
tender in the payment of money made in the silver
coin of the realm, of any sum exceeding the sum of
£25 at any one time, shall be reputed in law or
allowed to be a legal tender within Great Britain or
Ireland for more than according to its value by
weight, after the rate of 5s. 2d. per oz. of silver, and
no person to whom such tender shall be made shall
be any way bound thereby or obliged to receive the <!-- Page 236 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
same in payment in any manner than as aforesaid;
any law, statute, or usage to the contrary notwithstanding."</p>

<p>The importance of this latter epoch-making clause
is vital. It is the first enactment of a law of tender
in the history of English monetary legislation, and it
was the first step towards the shaking off the incubus
of that mediæval currency system which was even
then only coming to be understood in all its fatal
perniciousness. For statesmanship, the only parallel
to it is that Act of Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> of France, which proved
so shortlived in its adoption (see <i>supra</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_87">87</a>-<a href="#Page_88">88</a>).
It was the first step in the evolution of that system of
a safeguarded currency which was finally constructed
in 1816.</p>

<p>This Act prohibiting the importation of light silver
was renewed in 1776 for a further two years, and was
again, in 1778, continued until the 1st day of May
1783, and from thence to the end of the next session
of Parliament. On the 21st June 1798 the Act,
being then expired, was revived and further continued
to the 1st day of June 1799 by a new statute, and on
the 12th July 1799 the Act was made perpetual by
statute of 39 Geo. <span class="smcap">III.</span> c. 75.</p>

<p>The later legislative action with regard to silver
belongs to the final construction of the English
currency system. In the main, the recoinage of gold
was accomplished in the year 1774, though it lingered
over the three succeeding years as appears by the
items in the Appropriation Acts. <!-- Page 237 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>The accounts of grants for recoinage were as

</table></div>

<p>The scope of this series of Acts of 1774 will be
seen at a glance; as well as the tendency in policy,
namely, in favour of gold, which it indicated. The
gold coinage was renewed, and as a safeguard against
its future depreciation the existing depreciated coin
was cut off from any sapping action upon it by the
above restriction as to tender by weight. For the
renewal of the silver coinage itself no actual measures
were taken save the prohibition of the import of light
coins.</p>

<p>For more than twenty years the defective state of
the silver coin continued quite unheeded; evidently as
no longer causing international embarrassment, now
that its function and differentiating action upon the
companion metal had been partially tied down and
limited.</p>

<p>In 1787 the depreciation of the silver coinage
was ascertained experimentally, when it was found
that half-crowns were defective by over 9 per
cent., shillings by over 24 per cent., and sixpences
by more than 38 per cent. of their proper weight. <!-- Page 238 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
To this depreciation was added an exterior cause
of drain by the action of France, who in 1792
increased the scarcity of silver coins and bullion
by the issue of her assignats. In that year not
less than 2,909,000 oz. of silver were purchased
with assignats and sent into France. Five years
later an attempt was made to supply the deficiency
of the silver coins by the issue of Spanish
<i>dollars</i>, countermarked with the hall mark of the
King's head. This was after the Bank of England
had, in accordance with the minute of the Privy
Council of 26th February 1797, suspended cash
payments.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND: ACT OF 1798</i></div>

<p>On the 7th of February of the following year, 1798,
the subsisting Committee of Council for Coins was
dissolved, and a new committee appointed to consider
the state of the coins and Mint. During its deliberations,
and until it established the new rule, the further
coining of silver was suspended by the Act already
spoken of, which (21st June 1798) revived the old
law against importation of light silver. This suspension
of silver coinage was simply a temporary precaution.
"Whereas," says the Act, "His Majesty has
appointed a committee of his Privy Council to take
into consideration the state of the coins of this kingdom,
and the present establishment and constitution
of His Majesty's Mint, and inconvenience may arise
from any coinage of silver until such regulations may
be framed as shall appear necessary; and whereas
from the present low price of silver bullion, owing to<!-- Page 239 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
temporary circumstances, a small quantity of silver
bullion has been brought to the Mint to be coined, and
there is reason to suppose that a still further quantity
may be brought, and it is therefore necessary to suspend
the coining of silver for the present, be it therefore
enacted that no silver bullion shall be coined at
the Mint, nor shall any silver coin that may have been
coined there be delivered."</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that this enactment was
due to Lord Liverpool, and if so that it was intended
as an arrest, with a particular intent or bearing; for
Liverpool had formed his conception of a monetary
theory as early as 1773. None the less it is quite
inadmissible to state, as has been done, that this
restriction, so evidently and expressly only a temporary
or interim measure of self-defence, was equivalent
to a placing upon the statute-book of Lord Liverpool's
gold monometallical theory. There was as yet no
restriction on the legal tender of silver. It was still
legal tender to any amount,&mdash;it was indeed the standard
coin of the realm,&mdash;only, in order to avoid the effects
of depreciation, and to prevent further depreciation,
it was now the law of the land that payments of silver
of sums over £25 should be made by weight, and the
further coinage of silver was temporarily stopped.</p>

<p>This was not a gold monometallic system, and
the Act which established that system was passed
eight years after the death of Lord Liverpool, and
six years after the Bullion Report of 1810 had been
printed. <!-- Page 240 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND: THE BANK RESTRICTION</i></div>

<p>Further than incidentally it is inconsistent with
the design of this book to refer to the period of suspension
of cash payments and the Bullion Report.
These latter are banking phenomena, and will find
their place in a treatise of currency in the fuller
acceptance of the term, rather than in a treatise definitely
restricted to the subject of the metallic currencies.
The events of 1797 which led to the suspension,&mdash;the
remittances to the Continent for war purposes, a
failure of credit, a run on the country banks, and then
upon the London banks,&mdash;had been experienced in
1793 as acutely as in 1797; and, according to the
express statement of the report itself, even in the
years 1796 and 1797, when the country bankers were
making great demands in order to increase their
deposits, the market price of gold never rose above
the Mint price. These events were therefore one
phase of the internal experiences of the country, and
have no relation to an international outflow of gold,
caused by the heightened ratio which definitely set in
in 1794. On the mere ground of first principles,
therefore, it is inadmissible to make argumentative
use of this event, known as the Bank Restriction, for
judgment and illustration in the wider question of
bimetallism. Further, the argumentative use that
has been made of it&mdash;viz. that if from 1773 to
1797 England had possessed a true rather than a
halting bimetallic régime, she would have been
supplied by its means with an amount of silver that
would have increased the metallic reserve and <!-- Page 241 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
strength of the country, and enabled it to avoid
suspension&mdash;is inadmissible: and the argument itself
is untenable. Such bimetallic action supplying silver
could only have begun to operate in 1794, three years
before the suspension. It could only have operated
by substituting one metal for the other, not by adding
silver to gold, but by taking away higher valued gold,
and furnishing lower valued silver, <i>i.e.</i> by actually
decreasing the metallic strength and reserve of the
kingdom. And, lastly, there is the peculiar fact still
requiring explaining, that the years of the bank restriction,
until, that is, the new Mint law of 1816, saw the
heaviest export of silver probably that England has
ever experienced. During the ten years, 1801-10,
nearly 10 millions sterling of silver was exported from
England (over 38,176,016 oz.), while the gold exports
amounted only to £2,088,483, so that, of the total
export, silver formed 82 per cent. (net amounts used
in both cases). It is still well known to what straits
this export of silver put the country. In almost every
town where there was any employment of labour the
tradesmen were obliged to issue token money of their
own&mdash;shilling tokens, sixpenny tokens, half-crown
and five-shilling promissory-notes. Every conceivable
form of hand-to-mouth unauthorised currency
was resorted to, in order to relieve the needs of the
situation caused by the want of silver coins. And
stories are still remembered of the straits to which the
working classes were driven in order to make their
purchases at the week end with one pound notes, for <!-- Page 242 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
which they could get no change. The explanation
of such a phenomenon can only be that the one pound
notes having driven gold out of circulation, by a law
which is merely another form of the bimetallic law,
left only silver available for remittance to the Continent
for loans and war purpose. But, whatever the
explanation, the fact cuts the ground from under the
argument that bimetallism would have saved England
from the bank restriction. If silver had not been
legal tender to any amount (up to £25 by tale, and
beyond that by weight), or again if it had been protected
by an agio in 1808 as it was in 1816, it could
not have left the country. The straits of the poorer
classes in those years of hardship were <i>due</i> to the
existing bimetallic system, and to it must, therefore,
be attributed the aggravation rather than alleviation
of the bank restriction.</p>

<p>If anything is required to confirm such view it can
be found in the very terms of that statute of 1816
(56 Geo. <span class="smcap">III.</span> c. 68), which established the gold standard
in England. They reveal the fact that the Act was
not so much a philosophical or theoretical declaration
of monometallism, such as might have been expected
if Lord Liverpool had still lived to dictate it, but a
measure for the protection of and relating almost
entirely to silver.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND: THE ACT OF 1816</i></div>

<p>"Whereas the silver coins of the realm have, by
long use and other circumstances, become greatly
diminished in number and deteriorated in value, so as
not to be sufficient for the payments required in dealings <!-- Page 243 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
under the value of the current gold coins, by reason
whereof a great quantity of light and counterfeit silver
coin and foreign coin has been introduced into circulation
within this realm, and the evils resulting therefrom
can only be remedied by a new coinage of silver
money...."</p>

<p>The Act therefore prescribes the coining of silver,
11 oz. 2 dwts. fine, at a tale after the rate of 66s. per
Troy pound, whether the same be coined in crowns,
half-crowns, shillings, or sixpences, or pieces of a lower
denomination, but to be issued to the importer of the
silver, or to the public, after a rate of 62s. per pound
Troy.</p>

<p>"And whereas at various times heretofore the
coins of this realm of gold and silver have been usually
a legal tender for payments to any amount, and great
inconvenience has arisen from both these precious
metals being concurrently the standard measure of
value and equivalent of property, it is expedient that
the gold coin made according to the indentures of the
Mint should henceforth be the sole standard measure
of value and legal tender for payment, without any
limitation of amount, and that the silver coin should
be a legal tender to a limited amount only, for the
facility of exchange and commerce." The Act therefore
prescribes the limit of 40s. for the tender of silver.</p>

<p>This Act was repealed, but in substance re-enacted
by the Coinage Act of 1870, and is still in principle
and fact the law of the land and the basis of our
monometallic system. <!-- Page 244 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENGLAND: 1816-93</i></div>
<p>From the date of its enactment England has been
withdrawn from that action of bimetallic law which
had been her bane for centuries. The flow of gold in
or out became automatic, representing the natural
flow of world-balances, and therefore proving the
greatest trade help and indicator; and such commercial
crises as have come upon her have arisen from the
peculiarly sensitive organisation of credit which
distinguishes the modern system, and are to be
classed with banking rather than metallic currency
phenomena.</p>

<p>The total coinage in England from 1816 to 1875
inclusive was £234,139,886 gold and £24,663,309
silver.</p>

<h5>United States</h5>

<p>Under British dominion the American colonies
retained the silver standard, as did their mother
country, with such variation of actual coins and of
their tariff as the situation of the country and the
immense variety of metallic values prevailing in the
different colonies gave rise to. The coin most
commonly current was the Spanish <i>piece of eight</i>, but
the system of weights and measures was the English
system, and reckoning was by pounds, shillings, and
pence. The method by which such a composite
system was regulated consisted in those coinage
tariffs with which early European monetary history is
so well acquainted. According to a tariff issued in
1750, the ounce of silver was declared worth 6s. 8d<span class="correction" title="period added">.</span>
the Spanish milled <i>piece of eight</i> was to be equal to 6s.;<!-- Page 247 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
and "whereas there is great reason to apprehend that
many and great inconveniences may arise in case any
coined silver or gold or English halfpence and
farthings should pass at any higher rate than in a
just proportion to Spanish pieces of eight, or coined
silver at the ratio aforesaid," a tariff list was appended
according to which the guinea was 28s., the <i>English
crown</i> 6s. 8d., and so on for other European
coins.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>UNITED STATES: MORRIS'S SCHEME, 1782</i></div>

<p>In accordance with this system the earliest financial
steps of the Continental Congress in 1775&mdash;its issues
of bills of credit&mdash;were based upon, and the bills were
declared payable in, the Spanish <i>dollar</i> or <i>piece of
eight</i>, to which, on the report of a special commission,
appointed on 19th April 1776, the various gold and
silver coins circulating by different standards in
different colonies were rated by a tariff. According
to this tariff the guinea weighing 5 dwts. 8 grs. was
to be equivalent to 4 <span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> dollars, and the English crown
equal to 1 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">9</span> dollar.</p>

<p>Gold bullion was rated 17 dollars per oz. Troy
weight; sterling silver at 1 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">9</span> dollar per oz.</p>

<p>Assuming the coins to be of full weight, the ratio
here established is nearly the English ratio of 15.21.
The ratio for bullion is slightly different, but hardly
materially.</p>

<p>Six years later, at the request of a committee of
Congress, the superintendent of finance, Robert
Morris, submitted a scheme for a national coinage
(15th January 1782). This scheme is remarkable for <!-- Page 248 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
its clear-sightedness and grasp, as well as the testimony
it bore to the European monetary system of the
time. After deciding on silver as a necessary unit,
the report thus proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The various coins which have circulated in
America have undergone different changes in their
value, so that there is hardly any which can be
considered as a general standard unless it be Spanish
dollars. These pass in Georgia at 5s., in North
Carolina and New York at 8s., in Virginia and the
four Eastern States at 6s., in all the other States
except South Carolina at 7s. 6d., and in South
Carolina at 32s. 6d."</p>

<p>As a common denominator, calculated from part
of these figures, Morris proposed a monetary unit of
 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-grain in fine silver, the multiples to be by the decimal
system, the dollar containing 1440 units, and the
Mint price of fine silver being 22,237 units per pound.</p>

<p>On the following 21st February 1782 Congress
approved of the establishment of a Mint, and directed
Morris to prepare and report a plan for conducting it.</p>

<p>In a concurrent paper of notes on the establishment
of a money unit, and of a coinage for the United
States, Jefferson proposed, in opposition to Morris's
scheme, a decimal system resting on the dollar, and
with a ratio of 15:1.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>UNITED STATES: REPORT OF 1785</i></div>

<p>"Just principles," he says, after stating the legal
ratio in the chief European countries, "will lead us to
disregard legal proportions altogether, to inquire into
the market price of gold in the several countries with <!-- Page 249 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
which we shall be principally connected in commerce,
and to take an average from them. Perhaps we
might well safely lean to a proportion somewhat above
par for gold, considering our neighbourhood and
commerce with the sources of the coins, and the
tendency which the high price of gold in Spain has to
draw thither all that of their mines, leaving silver
principally for our and other markets."</p>

<p>The settlement of the matter was, however,
delayed, although in the course of the year Morris
declared that "all our dollars are rapidly going to
the enemy in exchange for light gold, which must
eventually cause a considerable loss and a scarcity of
silver which will be seriously felt."</p>

<p>In this undetermined state the matter rested till
13th May 1785, when the grand committee on the
money unit made its report.</p>

<p>The proposed ratio was justified thus: "In
France 1 grain of pure gold is counted worth
15 grs. of silver. In Spain 16 grs. of silver are
exchanged for 1 of gold, and in England 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">5</span>. In
both England and Spain gold is the prevailing money,
because silver is undervalued. In France silver
prevails. Sundry advantages would arise to us from
a system by which silver might become the prevailing
money. This would operate as a bounty to draw it
from our neighbours, by whom it is not sufficiently
esteemed. Silver is not exported so easily as gold,
and it is a more useful metal. Certainly our exchange
should not be more than 15 grs. of silver for 1 of <!-- Page 250 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
gold." The charge for coinage was to be 2 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> per
cent. for gold, and slightly over 3 per cent. for silver.
The unit was to be a dollar of 362 grs. of pure
silver, with a multiple gold piece (5 dollars) and
decimal aliquot pieces.</p>

<p>On the 6th July following, 1785, the Congress by
vote adopted the silver dollar as the basis of the
currency on a decimal system, but the resolution
was not followed by the establishment of a Mint,
although the States were experiencing great loss by
the circulation of base copper coins made in Birmingham.</p>

<p>On the 8th April 1786, a report was made in
triplicate by the Board of Treasury to the President of
Congress, the first of the three forms of the report
advocating a silver dollar of 375.64 grs. fine and a
ratio of 15.256. These proposals were adopted by
resolution on the 8th August following, and on the
16th October of the same year, 1786, the ordinance
for the establishment of the Mint of the United
States of America, and for regulating the value and
alloy of coin, finally passed Congress.</p>

<p>In accordance with the resolutions of 8th August,
the mint price of the pound Troy of gold (11 parts
fine) was fixed at 209 dols. 7 dimes, 7 cents, and of
silver at 13 dols. 7 dimes, 7 cents, and 7 mills.</p>

<p>The Mint charge here comprised is about 2 per
cent. on both silver and gold, "bringing the ratio of
bullion at the Mint to 15.22, a little below the ratio in
the coin." <!-- Page 251 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>UNITED STATES: HAMILTON'S REPORT, 1791</i></div>

<p>For several years all these regulations of Congress
were not put in force, and it was not until 5th May
1791 that the matter was again brought before the
Senate by the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
Alexander Hamilton.</p>

<p>Hamilton's scheme, as contained in his most
remarkable paper, was for a silver unit or dollar of
371 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> grs. of pure silver and a ratio of 15, and instead
of the allowance of 2 per cent. for waste and coinage
the principle was adopted of free coinage&mdash;of delivering
at the Mint the same weight of pure metal coined
as should be brought to it in bullion or foreign coin.
Hamilton justifies his ratio thus: "The difference
established by custom in the United States between
coined gold and coined silver has been stated to be
nearly 1:15.6. This, if truly the case, would imply
that gold was extremely <span class="correction" title="corrected from 'over-valued'">overvalued</span> in the United
States, for the <i>highest actual</i> proportion in any part
of Europe very little, if at all, exceeds 1:15, and the
average proportion throughout Europe is probably
not more than 1:14.8." He also deduces his ratio
of 15 as a mean between the two lately preceding
issues of dollars. "Taking the rate of the late dollar
of 374 grs., the proportion would be as 1:15.11.
Taking the rate of the newest dollar of 374 grs.,
the proportion would be as 1:14.87. The mean of
the two would give the proportion of 1:15 very
nearly, less than the legal proportion in the coins of
Great Britain, which is as 1:15.2, but somewhat
more than the actual or market proportion, which is <!-- Page 252 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
not quite 1:15." As to the express selection of one or
other metal for the unit, Hamilton makes a departure
which marks clearly that he was creating and not continuing
a system, and that if bimetallism is a feature of
modern conception that conception is due to American
rather than French statesmanship:<a name="FNanchor_18_22" id="FNanchor_18_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_22" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>&mdash;"Contrary to
the ideas which have heretofore prevailed in the
suggestions concerning a coinage for the United
States, though not without much hesitation arising
from a deference for those ideas, the secretary is,
upon the whole, strongly inclined to the opinion that
a preference ought to be given to neither of the
metals for the monetary unit ... because this
cannot be done effectually without destroying the
office and character of one of them as money and
reducing it to the situation of mere merchandise,
which, accordingly, at different times, has been
proposed from different and very reputable quarters,
but which would probably be a greater evil than
occasional variations in the unit, from the fluctuations
in the relative value of the metals, especially if care
be taken to regulate the proportion between them,
with an eye to their average commercial value. To
annul the use of either of the metals as money is to
abridge the quantity of circulating medium." <!-- Page 253 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>UNITED STATES: SCHEME OF 1792</i></div>

<p>This scheme was accepted in its entirety by the
Act of 2nd April 1792, with the slight change
that the standard of silver was changed from  <span class="above">11</span>&#8260;<span class="below">12</span>
to 1 <span class="above">485</span>&#8260;<span class="below">1664</span> fine. The silver dollar, therefore, weighed
416 grs. gross (371 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> grs. pure silver); on this basis,
at a ratio of 15, the equivalent gold piece would
contain 24.75 grs. (371 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>/25 = 27 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>). This was accordingly
established as the basis of the gold <i>eagle</i> or
ten-dollar piece, which was to contain 270 grs. gross
(247.5 grs. pure gold).<a name="FNanchor_19_23" id="FNanchor_19_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_23" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The Act was followed by
another on the 9th February 1793, for regulating the
rate of foreign coins. The gold coins of Great
Britain and Portugal of their then standard were
made a legal tender for the payment of all debts and
demands, at the rate of 100 cents for every 27 grs. of
their actual weight, those of France and Spain at the
rate of 100 cents for every 27 <span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">5</span> grains.</p>

<p>For a period the system established in 1792 went
on, although the ratio established was prejudicial to
gold. But, twenty years after, the natural result
arrived in America, as in England, and the circulation
of gold was completely extinguished in the States by
the unseen withdrawal of the metal.</p>

<p>In obedience to a resolution of the Senate of 3rd
March 1817, John Quincy Adams, Secretary of
State, produced a report on weights and measures, in <!-- Page 254 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
which he impugned the correctness of the data on
which Hamilton had based his reckoning in 1791.</p>

<p>Two years later, 26th January 1819, a committee
of the House reported an ill-considered scheme,
recommending a change in the ratio in favour of gold,
and the imposition of a heavy seigniorage on silver.
On the 1st of March following, the House of Representatives
directed the secretary to report such
measures as might be expedient to procure and retain
a sufficient quantity of gold and silver coin in the
United States.</p>

<p>In this report, in referring to one feature in the
previous crisis, namely, the necessity in 1814 for the
suspension of specie payments, Secretary Crawford
stated that, from the commencement of the war until
that event of 1814, a large amount of specie was
taken out of the United States by the sale of
English Government bills, at a discount frequently
of 15 to 20 per cent.</p>

<p>He concluded by suggesting a raising of the value
of gold in relation to silver, 5 per cent., implying a
ratio of 15.75.</p>

<p>In the report to the House of Representatives,
dated 17th March 1832, quite a different statement was
made, namely, that there was no export of gold from
the United States from 1792 to 1821, and that "there
were certainly no indications that gold was rated too
low in our standard of 1:15 earlier than 1821, when
the English demand commenced."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>UNITED STATES: GOLD EXPORT OF 1820</i></div>

<p>The terms of the report of the committee on the <!-- Page 255 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
currency, which was communicated to the House of
Representatives on the 2nd February 1821, must be
contrasted with this statement. "The committee are
of opinion that the value of American gold compared
with silver ought to be somewhat higher than by law
at present established. On inquiry they find that
gold coins, both foreign and of the United States,
have in a great measure disappeared, and from the
best calculation that can be made there is reason to
apprehend they will be wholly banished from circulation,
and it ought not to be a matter of surprise,
under our present regulations, that this should be the
case.... There have been coined at the Mint of
the United States 6 millions of dollars in gold. It
is doubtful whether any considerable portion of it
can at this time be found within the United States....
It is ascertained that the gold coin, in an office of
discount and deposit of the Bank of the United States
in November 1819, amounted to 165,000 dollars and
the silver coin to 118,000; that since that time the
silver coin has increased to 700,000 dollars, while the
gold coin has diminished to 1200 dollars, 100 only of
which is American."<a name="FNanchor_20_24" id="FNanchor_20_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_24" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The committee proposed a bill in the sense of
their report, but for seven years&mdash;years of acute
commercial crises and distress&mdash;no actual step was
taken. In November of the following year the subject
of the disappearance of gold from the currency <!-- Page 256 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
was brought before the lower house of Congress by
Mr. Lowndes. In December 1828, however, the
Senate required the Secretary of the Treasury to
ascertain the ratio and to state such alterations in the
gold coins as might be necessary to conform those
coins to the silver coins in their true relative value.</p>

<p>In his report Secretary Ingham insisted on the
advantage of a single standard, but, in case of a
determination to maintain both gold and silver, he
proposed to approximate as near as could be to the
French system by establishing a ratio of 15.625. In
case of no change of the ratio he proposed to discontinue
the gold coinage, whenever the premium for
gold should exceed 2 per cent.</p>

<p>No action was taken on these reports, nor on the
similar proceedings in the two following years, nor
very little more on the report which in June 1832
the select committee on coins produced. Part of the
instructions given to this committee were "to inquire
into the expediency of making silver the only legal
tender, and of coining and issuing gold coins of a fixed
weight and fineness, which shall be received in payment
of all debts to the United States, at such ratio
as may be fixed from time to time but shall not
otherwise be a legal tender."</p>

<p>In the House of Representatives the converse
proposition of a gold standard with a restricted legal
tender had been made by M. Wilde, 26th March
1832, but when the report appeared it advocated a
silver standard. <!-- Page 257 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>UNITED STATES: THE ACT OF 1834</i></div>

<p>While Congress was thus delaying over a vital
question the New York bankers, May 1834, pressed
for the regulation of the gold coins, so as to retain
them in the country.</p>

<p>Two months later, 31st July 1834, the long-sought
measure passed, but in an extraordinary form. At a
blow the ratio was changed from 1:15 to 1:16
(15.988), by the reduction of the weight of the fine
gold in the gold coins to 23.20 Troy grains, soon
afterwards, by an Act of 18th July 1837, changed to
23.22 grains, the standard being changed at the
same time from  <span class="above">11</span>&#8260;<span class="below">12</span> to  <span class="above">9</span>&#8260;<span class="below">10</span> fine.</p>

<p>The motives and amount of wisdom which underlay
this sudden close of a long period of agitation can
be measured from Benton's own words, in his <i>Thirty
Years' View</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A measure of relief was now at hand, before
which the machinery of distress was to balk and
cease its long and cruel labours&mdash;it was the passage
of the bill for equalising the value of gold and silver
and legalising the tender of foreign coins of both
metals. The bills were brought forward in the
House by Mr. Campbell H. White of New York, and
passed after an animated contest in which the chief
question was as to the true relative value of the two
metals, varied by some into a preference for National
Bank paper; 15 <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> was the ratio of nearly all who
seemed best calculated from their pursuits to understand
the subject. The thick array of speakers was
on that side, and the eighteen banks of the city of <!-- Page 258 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
New York, with Mr. Gallatin at their head, favoured
that proportion. The difficulty of adjusting this value,
so that neither metal should expel the other had been
the stumblingblock for a great many years, and now
this seemed to be as formidable as ever. Refined
calculations were gone into, scientific light was sought,
history was rummaged back to the times of the Roman
Empire; and there seemed to be no way of getting
to a concord of opinion either from the light of science,
the voice of history, or the result of calculations.
The author of this <i>View</i> had, in his speeches on
the subject, taken up the question in a practical point
of view, regardless of history and calculations and the
opinions of bank officers; and looking to the actual
and equal circulation of the two metals in different
countries he saw that this equality and actuality of circulation
had existed for above three hundred years in
the Spanish dominions of Mexico and South America,
where the proportion was 16:1. Taking his stand
upon this single fact, as the practical test which solved
the question, all the real friends of the gold currency
soon rallied to it. Mr. White gave up the bill which
he had first introduced, and adopted the Spanish ratio.
Mr. Clowney of South Carolina, Mr. Gillet, and Mr.
Cambreleng of New York, Mr. Ewing of Indiana,
Mr. McKim of Maryland, and other speakers gave
it a warm support. Mr. John Quincy Adams would
vote for it, though he thought the gold was overvalued,
but if found to be so the difference could be
corrected hereafter. The principal speakers against <!-- Page 259 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
it and in favour of a lower rate were Messrs. Gorham
of Massachusetts, Selden of New York, Binney of
Pennsylvania, and Wilde of Georgia, and eventually
the bill was passed by a large majority, 145 to 35. In
the Senate it had an easy passage. Messrs. Calhoun
and Webster supported it, Mr. Clay opposed it; and
on the final vote there were but seven negatives&mdash;Messrs.
Chambers of Maryland, Clay, Knight of
Rhode Island, Alexander Porter of Louisiana, Silsbee
of Massachusetts, Southard of New Jersey, Sprague
of Maine. The good effects of the bill were immediately
seen. Gold began to flow into the country
through all the channels of commerce, old chests gave
up their hordes, the Mint was busy; and in a few
months, as if by magic, a currency banished from the
country for thirty years overspread the land and gave
joy and confidence to all the pursuits of industry."</p>

<p>The panacea thus magnificently lauded soon
proved itself worse than inefficient. The ratio was
too high, and the silver dollars could not be maintained.
They were unduly exported, especially
between the years 1848 and 1851. And in
order to retain within the country a sufficient
amount of small coin the amount of silver in the
small coins, from the half-dollar downwards, was
reduced by an Act of 24th February 1853. It was
at the same time provided that they should be coined
only on Government account, and they were made
legal tender only up to the sum of five-dollars.</p>

<p>The direction of this step will be seen at a glance&mdash;it <!-- Page 260 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
was in the direction of the gold valuation. This
is as plainly the case as it was in the Latin Union,
already exemplified (p. <a href="#Page_190">190</a>). Further, it was so
conceived and explicitly stated by Dunham, who
piloted the bill through the House. "We have
had," he said, "but a single standard for the last
three or four years. That has been and now is gold.
We propose to let it remain so, and to adapt silver to
it, to regulate it by it." Legally, the old silver dollar
was left untouched, and the gold and silver valuation
was not expressly abolished. No reference whatever
was made to the silver dollar in the Act, for the
simple reason that for years nothing had been seen of
them. They did not and could not circulate. There
was plenty of gold, and the absence of silver with the
change in standard therein practically implied was
either unnoticed, or regarded, if at all, only with
indifference.</p>

<p>The final step in the simplification and unification
of this system was commenced in 1870, when a bill
was prepared for a revised coinage law with a pure
gold standard, silver being demonetised as a legal
tender money. The bill did not become law till
12th April 1873. And no opposition was expressed
in either the House of Representatives or the Senate
to the abolition of the double standard. The silver
dollars previously coined (of which, however, but few
were in existence) maintained their quality as legal
tender; but the coining of new dollars, whether on
Government or private account, was forbidden. <!-- Page 261 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>UNITED STATES: THE LEGISLATION OF 1873-74</i></div>

<p>This Act was therefore simply the complement of
the preceding legislation of 1853.</p>

<p>The completion of this system thus established
was provided in section 3586 of the Revised Statutes
of 1874, by which the silver coins of the United
States were declared legal tender only up to five
dollars, thus completing, from December 1873
onwards, the demonetisation of silver, and the
establishment of gold monometallism on the English
plan. As an effective scheme it meant little because
of the prevalence of paper.</p>

<p>Within a very short time of the passing of this
bill, however, began the great change in the relative
value of the precious metals which has continued
since. The silver-producing interest, at that
moment on the eve of receiving an enormous
accession of strength by the Nevada finds, made
itself heard. At the same time the prospect of the
resumption of cash payments brought an additional
incentive and interest. A commission to investigate
the question of standard was therefore appointed,
14th August 1875, and a majority of this
commission recommended the establishment of the
double standard. Thereupon Bland, one of the
members of the commission, proposed in the House
of Representatives the re-establishment of the double
standard, at the old ratio of 1:15.988, with free coinage
of silver.</p>

<p>The question of resumption was pressing near.
On the 1st January 1879 the States were to return <!-- Page 262 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
to cash payments. On what basis should that return
be effected? Should the Act of 1873 be maintained,
or should a return be made to the bimetallic system
which had prevailed before then? The Government
was of the former opinion; the majority of Congress
of the latter.</p>

<p>The silver party, finding the measure could not be
carried over the veto of the president, agreed to a
compromise, under which the free coinage clause was
dropped, and it was as a compromise that the Bland
Act so-called, the "Act to authorise the coinage of
the standard silver dollar, and to restore its legal
tender character," passed on the 28th February 1878.</p>

<p>To the favourers of a gold system it was conceded
that in the maintenance of the previous legal ratio
of 15.988, the silver dollar should be reserved for
Treasury reckonings, and a maximum minting limit of
4 million dollars monthly should be fixed. The bimetallists
gained the fixing of a minimum limit of 2
million dollars monthly of silver coinage, and the
clause enjoining the President of the United States
to take steps for the meeting of an international
conference.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>UNITED STATES: BLAND AND SHERMAN ACTS</i></div>

<p>This scheme became law immediately, and on the
1st January 1879 the United States resumed specie
payment. As far as the actual circulation of the
country is concerned this return is only nominally
effective. The habit of employing redeemable paper
had grown too strong and continuous, and even the
rule of the New York banking-houses, to employ<!-- Page 263 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
only gold in clearing-house settlements, has been
formally, though not absolutely, abolished by the
Act of Congress of 12th July 1882, which provided
that no national bank should be a member of a clearing-house
at which gold and silver certificates were
not accepted in payment of balances. The Bland
Bill deceived the hope of both parties, as such a
compromise might be expected to do. It remained in
force, notwithstanding, till August 1890, and during
the twelve years, 1878-1890, the United States
coined a matter of 370 million silver dollars, employing
therein 9 million kilogrammes of silver&mdash;a
third of the total contemporary production.</p>

<p>Almost yearly, up to 1887, the repeal of the
silver purchase clauses of the Bland Bill and the
suspension of the silver coinage was recommended
to Congress by presidential message, and in the
reports of the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<p>In December 1889 President Harrison and Secretary
Windam definitely proposed to cease the coining
of silver, and to limit the issues of silver certificates
to the value of the silver bullion as deposited,
reckoning that value at its then market price.
From these proposals sprang, by the same peculiar
process of committee gestation which had produced
the Bland Act, the compromise which passed on
the 14th July 1890, under the title of the Sherman
Act.</p>

<p>This act represents a compromise not of principles
but of self-seeking interests. The main regulations of<!-- Page 264 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
the law, which came into force on the 13th August
1890, were:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The Secretary of the Treasury is to purchase
silver to not more than the monthly amount of
4,500,000 oz. at the market price, so long as that
price is below 129.29 cents per oz.</p>

<p>2, 3. To issue Treasury notes against the purchases,
the said notes to be full legal tender, and
capable of forming part of bank reserves.</p>

<p>5. Up to 1st July 1891, 2 million oz. monthly of
this silver to be coined into dollars. That coinage
to cease after the date specified, except so far as
necessary to secure the Treasury notes. At the
same time the Act declares the intention of the
American Government to preserve the parity of gold
and silver.</p>

<p>The fillip given by this legislation to the price of
silver was over in a moment, and almost immediately
the question recurred for pressing consideration, on
the strong demand of the silver party for free coinage
in place of these as yet ineffectual purchase schemes.
The impotent close of the international monetary
conference at Brussels, in February 1893, was
followed by the Act of the Governor-General of
India in Council of June 26th closing the Indian
Mint to the free coinage of silver. Left practically
alone in her stand in defence of silver, America, in
the simple interest of her gold reserve, was obliged
to abandon the field, and after a bitter fight the
repeal of the clauses of the Sherman Act, which had<!-- Page 265 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
enacted the compulsory purchase of silver, was
carried in November 1893.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>UNITED STATES: COINAGE 1793-1893</i></div>

<p>We are too near the event to estimate these later
developments of the situation, but as yet two remarkable
facts have hinged upon this report&mdash;(1) the
immediate depreciation of the value of silver and
the effect on the export of silver to India were not
such as might <i>a priori</i> have been conjectured; (2)
the ceasing of the silver purchase deprived the

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE NETHERLANDS IN 1816</i></div>


<h5>Netherlands.</h5>

<p>During the eighteenth century the monetary<!-- Page 269 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
history of the Netherlands loses its central and determining
importance. The details of the Mint laws,
which precede the later developments of the nineteenth
century, are therefore relegated to the <a href="#Page_345">Appendix
(No. IV. Holland).</a></p>

<p>When the United Provinces of the Netherlands
and Belgium were united under a single sceptre,
both countries had an immense variety of coins, for
formerly nearly every province claimed a right of
coining money. To meet the desire for a simple
and single system, a monetary law was passed in
1816 under King William <span class="smcap">I.</span> Its object was to arrive
at a currency having the old florin, called the florin
of 200<i>as</i>, as the unit. But at the same time a gold
piece of 10 florins was allowed. The florin contained
9.63 grms. of silver and the 10-florin piece 6.056
grms. of gold. The ratio was therefore 15.873,
whilst in France it was 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>.</p>

<p>Moreover, to respond to the desire of the inhabitants
of Belgium, the franc was accepted in the
public treasuries, but at too high a rate, viz.
at 47 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> cents, whereas it was worth only 46.8 cents.
The result was that the new 3-florin pieces on
leaving the Brussels Mint went to the Lille Mint,
to come back in the shape of 5-franc pieces.</p>

<p>The law was languidly carried out. Gold pieces
were principally coined, and in proportion as gold was
coined it became more and more difficult to coin silver.</p>

<p>In 1830 Belgium was separated from Holland,
and it was not till 1844 that the recoining of the old<!-- Page 270 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
money was seriously undertaken. The monetary
law had been already altered in 1839. Side by
side with the worn silver coins there were issued 5
or 10-florin gold pieces, which had been coined to
the amount of 172 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> millions of florins. The worn
and clipped silver coins not being available for
international transactions, gold formed the basis of
exchange. This was regulated not by the florin but
by  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">10</span> of the 10-florin gold piece. All difficulties it
was thought could be obviated by adopting a florin
of exactly 10 grms. weight, corresponding to the
decimal metric system, and .945 fine. As long as
the gold coins remained in circulation, and they were
of great use while the recoinage was going on, there
was thus a bimetallism with a ratio of 1:15.504.
From 1842-49 more than 85 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> millions of florins in
nominal value were called in and were recoined in
new silver pieces. The operation cost the State
8 millions of florins, 7 millions being the loss on the
old coins.</p>

<p>Before actually commencing the recoinage, the
question of standard had been carefully considered.
Silver was resolved on. For more than a century
and a half the florin had been the unit of all
transactions. As the recoinage advanced, further
attention was devoted to the necessity of instituting
the single standard. By the law of 26th September
1847, the system of single silver standard was
adopted. In June 1850 the gold coins were called in.
A total of 50 millions, not one-third of what had been<!-- Page 271 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
coined, was offered by the public. It was sold in
1850-51 by the Government, which thereby lost rather
more than 1 million.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HOLLAND IN 1872</i></div>

<p>There is a very noticeable point connected with
this reform. The law of September 1847 admitted
trade coins in gold by the side of the legal silver
coins and fractional money. Besides the ducats,
which are still in demand from time to time, there
were <i>Guillaumes d'or</i>, <i>double-</i> and <i>half-Guillaumes</i>.
These pieces were inscribed only with the weight
and fineness.</p>

<p>This system failed completely. Though the
gold Guillaume was coined of the same weight and
fineness as the old 10-florin piece, which was much in
request, people would not have it. The uncertainty
of its value made it unpopular. Between the years
1851 and 1853 only 10,000 Guillaumes, 10,000 half-Guillaumes,
and 2636 double-Guillaumes were coined,
and since 1853 not a single one has been coined.</p>

<p>All through the Californian and Australian gold
finds and until 1872, the price of silver remained
stationary for large transactions. Only in small
transactions did it exhibit from time to time some
slight fluctuations.</p>

which, equal to value of 1 kilogramme of silver, .945,
was as by the Netherlands standard.</p>

<p>At Amsterdam also the price of silver did not
change.</p>

<p>With the change in 1871 this repose was disturbed.
A commission was thereupon appointed, in
October 1872, to consider the situation, which reported
in the following December. It proposed to prohibit
the free minting of silver, and this was enacted by
the law of 21st May 1873. As long as there was still
a hope of Germany continuing her old system, the
commission merely proposed to coin a gold piece side
by side with the silver money. When, however,
Germany adopted the gold standard, the commission,
in its additional report of 26th June 1873, proposed to
do the same by the introduction of a legal tender
currency of 10- and 5-florin pieces in gold, and the
withdrawal of the silver standard coins issued under
the law of 1847. This measure did not meet the
approval of the States-General. For the moment
Holland had therefore no standard of value, the Mint
being closed to silver, and gold being unrecognised.
The consequent heavy fall in the exchange led to an
agitation which resulted in the enactment of the law
of 6th June 1875, which opened the Mint to the public
for the coining of golden 10-guilder pieces of .9 fine,
to be legal tender concurrently with the silver florins
at the ratio of 1 to 15.625 (calculated on a quotation
of 60.35 price per oz. of silver). The law was only
enacted for a year, and in the following May 1876 an<!-- Page 273 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
attempt was made to pass a bill for the introduction
of an exclusive gold standard, and for the demonetisation
of silver. The bill was rejected by the First
Chamber, and the law of 1875 renewed for another
year, and then (by the law of 9th December 1877)
renewed "until otherwise determined upon by law."</p>

<p>The result was the permanence of the limping
standard&mdash;a gold piece with free minting, side by side
with silver pieces whose minting is restricted, but
gold and silver pieces being alike of unlimited legal
tender.</p>

<p>On the 28th March 1877 the States-General passed
a law establishing, in the Dutch East Indies, the
double standard on the same basis as in Holland, <i>i.e.</i>
with the formal suspension of the further coinage of
silver. This law was promulgated in Java on the
7th June 1877.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PORTUGAL IN 1868</i></div>


<h5>Portugal.</h5>

<p>The first law respecting gold in Portugal is dated
4th August 1688.</p>

<p>By that law the price to be paid in the Lisbon
and Oporto Mints for a mark of gold (22 carats) was
96,000 reis (533 fr. 33 cents). This same gold was
valued at 102,400 reis (568 fr. 88 cents). For a
mark of silver of 11 dinheiros (<i>i.e.</i>  <span class="above">11</span>&#8260;<span class="below">12</span> fine) the value
was fixed at 6000 reis (33 fr. 33 cents), producing,
when minted, 6300 reis (35 francs). The legal ratio
at that date (1688) was 1:16 (for purchase price of
the metal), 1:16.25 (for the Mint issue rate).<!-- Page 274 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1747 the value of a mark of coined silver was
changed, and rose from 35 francs to 41 francs 66
cents (7500 reis), an enactment which changed the
ratio at a blow to 13.6.</p>

<p>This ratio remained until the beginning of the
present century, and led in short to the expulsion of
gold from the monetary circulation.</p>

<p>The law of the 6th March 1822 gave to a mark of
coined gold a fixed value of 120 milreis (666 francs
666 cents), and the gold piece, whose value was 6400
reis (35 francs 55 cents), had a value of 41 francs 66
cents (7500 reis). This law was repealed shortly
afterwards, together with those passed in the Cortes
of 1820, but was restored and ratified by another law
of the 24th November 1823, and by a special charter
of 5th June 1824.</p>

<p>The preamble of the law of 1822 had declared
that the equivalence of 13.5 between gold and silver
was very far from expressing the proportion of their
mercantile value, and that gold did not practically
come into circulation on account of the legal value of
such money being below its corresponding value in
bullion, the legal ratio was therefore raised to 16 in
1825.</p>

<p>In 1835 a new law, of the 24th April, gave the
coined silver mark the value of 7500 reis (41 francs
66 cents), which brought the equivalence to about
15.5, a figure which was considered the average
rate of exchange of money, whether national or
foreign. <!-- Page 275 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 3rd March 1847 a new law was passed
raising the value of the gold mark to 128,000 reis
(711 francs 11 cents), and the gold piece, whose
value had been fixed in 1822 at 41 francs 66
cents (7500 reis), rose to 44 francs 44 cents (8000
reis). After this law other legal measures were taken
which established the legal ratio of 16.5.</p>

<p>It was these incessant alterations of ratio which
led Portugal to abandon bimetallism. The preamble
of the law of 1854, which instituted the gold single
standard, expresses this, attesting that the circulation
felt the lack of harmony and the disorder produced
by alterations in the ratios, that the legal ratio
being higher than the commercial ratio hampered
the transmission of money and burdened all transactions.</p>

<p>The law was adopted unanimously by the Portuguese
Chambers.</p>


<h5>The International Conferences.</h5>

<p>The chief feature of the modern monetary
agitation&mdash;the international conferences and the
attempt at international system&mdash;is due to the rapid
development of bimetallic theory in France, and to
the initiative of the United States, as well as to the
universal or world-embracing needs of the situation,
and the extension of the domain of international
law or morality.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that this new era dates
from 1871, from the change in the German monetary<!-- Page 276 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
system and the commencement of the wide divergence
between the two metals. The formation of the
Latin Union was the initial step in the process,
although, in a smaller sphere, German monetary
history for centuries had been acquainted with Mint
conventions between very divergent systems, and
had shortly before furnished another illustration in
the Conference of Vienna in 1857. The first widely-embracing
international conference proper, however,
was the outcome of an expression of opinion in
the conclave of the Latin Union. It was called at
the invitation of France, and met at Paris on the
17th June 1867. The States represented were
Austria, Baden, Bavaria, Belgium, Denmark, Spain,
the United States, France, Great Britain, Greece,
Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Prussia, Russia,
Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, and
Würtemberg. The eight sessions of the conference
occupied till the 6th July 1867. All the states
except Holland declared in favour of a gold standard.
It closed without arriving at any actual or practical
conclusions, but the president, De Parieu, in his
concluding oration, considered himself justified in
asserting that the sense of the conference was in
favour of a gold monometallic standard, approximating,
as near as the occasions of future Mint
change in the various states would permit, to a unit
based on the 5-franc piece (620 tale to a kilogramme
of gold).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CONFERENCE OF 1868</i></div>

<p>Though without immediate practical result, the<!-- Page 277 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
conference initiated a wide movement. In England
it was followed by the appointment of a commission,
18th February 1868, "to consider and report upon
the proceeding of the said international monetary
conference, ... and to examine and report upon
the recommendations of the conference, and their
adaptability to the circumstances of the United
Kingdom, and whether it would be desirable to make
any and what changes in the coinage of the United
Kingdom, in order to establish, either wholly or
partially, such uniformity as the conference had held
in contemplation."</p>

<p>The commission sat from the 13th March to the
8th July 1868, but closed without practical decision,
in regard of the difficulties lying in the way of an
international coinage. In particular, the proposition
of a reduction of the pound sterling to the 25-franc
piece was rejected.</p>

<p>In France the whole course of public opinion,
both before and after the conference of 1876, and in
the concluding examination of the <i>Enquête</i> of 1865-69,
ran strongly in favour of gold monometallism, and
the opinion has been unflinchingly held and expressed
that only the breaking out of the Franco-German
War prevented the adoption of that system in France
and in the states of the Latin Union. It is hardly
too much to say that the conclusion of the war, with
the heavy war indemnity which she thereby suffered,
took the initiative in monetary legislation out of the
hands of France.<!-- Page 278 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>Along with the latest reconstruction of her hoary
imperial scheme, Germany effected her great and
greatly-needed monetary unification and reform. She
accomplished it on the basis of the old or French
ratio of 15:5, and for two years after the reception
of the scheme the price of silver maintained itself
moderately. On the 9th July 1873, however, she
completed the system by the Legal Tender Law,
which demonetised the silver currency, and gradually
more than two-thirds of the total old German silver
money was called in, melted into bullion, and flung
on the market. Concurrently, other changes were
at work on the Continent. In 1872 the Scandinavian
States followed the example of Germany and adopted
a gold in place of a former silver standard. By the
treaty of 18th December 1872 a common system was
established between Sweden, Norway, and Denmark.
For Sweden the conversion of the silver currency
was based on a ratio of 15.57, for Denmark 15.43,
and for Norway 15.44. Three years later the
Netherlands followed suit. By their law of 6th
June 1875 and 10th May 1876 they adopted a gold
in place of their previous silver standard at a basis
ratio of 15.625.</p>

<p>Before the completion of these widespread changes,
the great fall in the gold price of silver had begun,
and the United States in her silver-producing
interests, Great Britain in the interests of her Indian
dependency and in those of her trade with silver-using
countries, and the whole commercial world generally<!-- Page 279 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
in the dislocation of international exchange, found
themselves menaced by gravest danger.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DEPRECIATION OF SILVER</i></div>

<p>Before the inrush of silver to the Mint, caused by
such a fall, the Latin Union first limited and then
abandoned its coining of the 5-franc piece.</p>

<p>The fall of silver became thereby only the more
acute and confirmed. By July 1876 it had sunk to
46 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> per oz. Apprehension was universally felt, and
in both England and the United States fresh commissions
were appointed to consider the question.
The English commission on the depreciation of silver
was appointed in March 1876, and sat from the
20th March to the 8th May, under the presidency of
Mr. Goschen. The investigation turned upon the
causes of the prevailing situation, without any attempt
at the suggestion of a remedial positive system.</p>

<p>Later, in the same year (15th August), the
American Congress voted the appointment of a like
commission, to inquire into the causes of the depreciation
of silver and into the feasibility of a reconstruction
of a bimetallic system, as well as to devise a
ratio and measures for the facilitation of a return to
cash payments in the United States. This commission
resulted in a double report, the 'majority' and
the 'minority' report. The majority, comprising
Messrs. Jones, Bogy, Willard, Groesbeck, and Bland,
recommended the remonetisation of silver and the
recourse to a fresh international conference. This
latter proposition was expressed in the compromise
known as the Bland Bill, the "Act to authorise the <!-- Page 280 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
coinage of the standard silver dollar, and to restore its
legal tender character, 28th February 1878." Section
2 of this law imposed it upon the President of the
United States to invite the members of the Latin
Union and the other interested nations to an international
conference. On the invitation of France this
conference met in Paris on 10th August 1878.
The American delegates proposed the free coinage of
silver in an international agreement and its unrestricted
employ on a full equality of tender with gold.
The delegates of Belgium, Switzerland, and Norway
combated the proposals, and, on the part of England,
Mr. Goschen declared that while the complete demonetisation
of silver portended a commercial crisis to
which no parallel could be found, England could
consent to no serious modification of her currency
system. Germany was not represented, and in her
absence France adopted a waiting policy, and the
conference closed with an impotent expression of
opinion that, in view of the difference of opinion, it
was useless to discuss an international ratio, and that,
while it was necessary for the world to maintain the
currency of silver, the choice and treatment of each
or either metal must be left to the particular monetary
situation and needs of each separate state.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected that so lame a conclusion
could stand before the needs of the situation. On
the 19th May 1879 the landed interest in Germany
succeeded in driving the Chancellor of the Empire to
suspend the further sale of silver. The circumstance<!-- Page 281 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
gave fresh hope to the bimetallists, and a busy
propaganda was carried on throughout Europe and
the States. The renewed international conference
of 1881 is to be regarded as an outcome of this
movement.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CONFERENCE OF 1881</i></div>

<p>On the invitation of the United States and France
the third international conference met in Paris on the
19th April 1881. All the European States, Canada,
India, and the United States were represented.</p>

<p>France, through her delegates, Magnin, the
president of the conference, and Henri Cernuschi, at
once and boldly declared for bimetallism. The
United States, Italy, Austria, the Netherlands, and
British India followed suit. On behalf of their
states the British and German delegates declared
that no change in the currency systems of their
countries could be entertained, but in case of an
agreement among the chief nations certain regulations
to increase the monetary employment of silver might
be devised. Belgium, Switzerland, Greece, and the
Scandinavian kingdoms declared against bimetallism.
After a recess from the 30th June to the 19th May
the conference closed on the 8th July 1881 with a
nominal adjournment to the 12th April 1882, so as to
give room for possible currency legislation in the
meantime. On the day fixed, however, the conference,
as need hardly be said, did not reassemble.</p>

<p>Practically, in the interval between the second and
third of these international delegations, the monetary
situation had not perceptibly altered. The price of<!-- Page 282 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
silver in 1878 had been 52 <span class="above">9</span>&#8260;<span class="below">16</span>, in 1881 it was 51 <span class="above">11</span>&#8260;<span class="below">16</span>: the
general level of prices had, if anything, slightly improved,
while the production of silver had not materially
increased (from 2,551,000 kilogrammes in 1878 to
2,593,000 kilogrammes in 1881), though that of gold
had certainly decreased. The close of the conference
was, however, followed by a strong bimetallic agitation
in England and Germany, which found united
expression in the Bimetallic Congress at Cologne in
October 1882.</p>

<p>This congress unanimously adopted the following
resolutions:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That in order to the establishment of a firm ratio
between gold and silver, it is desirable for England
and Germany&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. To increase the employment of silver by minting
full tender silver by the side of the divisional
restricted tender silver.</p>

<p>"2. That Germany should withdraw all gold and
paper below the value of 10 marks [and replace it by
silver].</p>

<p>"3. That Germany should sell no more silver.</p>

<p>"4. That the Bank of England should put in practice
the clause of her charter which allowed her to
employ silver as part of the bank reserve."</p>

<p>The conclusions of this congress had, however, no
practical influence on the course of policy of either
nation.</p>

<p>In the United States a parallel though more
interested agitation was conducted, centring round<!-- Page 283 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
the yearly proposed repeal of the compulsory minting
clauses of the Bland Bill.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE ENGLISH GOLD AND SILVER COMMISSION</i></div>

<p>In England the commercial depression, consequent
upon falling prices and the dislocation of exchanges
with India and the East, ran its full course, and gave
fresh ground for activity to the then recently formed
Bimetallic League.</p>

<p>In the course of 1886 silver had sunk to 42d. per
oz., and when the royal commission on the depression
of trade and industry closed its investigations,
with the expression of a desire for an inquiry into
the state of the precious metals, the British Government
only too gladly acceded. On the 20th September
1886 the royal commission "to inquire into the
present changes in the relative values of the precious
metals" was appointed. Its final report was made in
October 1888, and, as is well remembered, was of a
divided nature. All the members of the commission
agreed that the action of the Latin Union in 1873
broke the link between gold and silver, which had
kept the price of silver, as measured by gold, constant
at about the legal ratio, and thereby left silver
exposed to the influence of all the factors which
go to determine the price of a commodity. On
the question of bimetallism, in reference to the
actual and to any possible currency system, the commissioners
disagreed, and made separate reports.
Lord Herschell, Sir C.W. Fremantle, Sir John
Lubbock, Sir Thomas Henry Farrer, J.W. Birch, and
Leonard H. Courtney expressed themselves adversely. <!-- Page 284 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>"Though unable to recommend the adoption of
what is commonly known as bimetallism, we desire
it to be understood that we are quite alive to the
imperfections of standards of value, which not only
fluctuate but fluctuate independently of each other,
and we do not shut our eyes to the possibility of future
arrangements between nations which may reduce these
fluctuations. One uniform standard of value for all
commercial nations would, no doubt, be a great
advantage. But we think that any premature and
doubtful step might, in addition to its other dangers
and inconveniences, prejudice and retard progress to
this end.</p>

<p>"We think also that many of the evils and dangers
which arise from the present condition of the currencies
of different nations have been exaggerated, and
that some of the expectations of benefit to be derived
from the changes which have been proposed would,
if such changes were adopted, be doomed to disappointment.</p>

<p>"Under these circumstances we have felt that the
wiser course is to abstain from recommending any
fundamental change in the system of currency under
which the commerce of Great Britain has attained its
present development."</p>

<p>From these opinions dissent was directly expressed
in Part <span class="smcap">III.</span> of the report by the remaining members&mdash;Sir
Louis Malet, A.J. Balfour, Henry Chaplin, Sir
D. Barbour, Sir W.H. Houldsworth, and Sir
Samuel Montague.<!-- Page 285 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DISSENT FROM REPORT OF COMMISSION</i></div>

<p>"We cannot doubt that if the system which prevailed
before 1873 were replaced in its integrity most
of the evils which we have above described would be
removed; and the remedy which we have to suggest
is simply the reversion to a system which existed before
the changes above referred to were brought about&mdash;a
system, namely, under which both metals were freely
coined into legal tender money at a fixed ratio over a
sufficiently large area.</p>

<p>"The remedy which we suggest is essentially
international in its character, and its details must be
settled in concert with the other powers concerned.</p>

<p>"It will be sufficient for us to indicate the essential
features of the agreement to be arrived at, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. Free coinage of both metals into legal tender
money.</p>

<p>"2. The fixing of a ratio at which the coins of
either metal shall be available for the payment of all
debts at the option of the debtor.</p>

<p>"We submit, therefore, that the chief commercial
nations of the world, such as the United States, Germany,
and the states forming the Latin Union, should,
in the first place, be consulted as to their readiness to
join with the United Kingdom in a conference, at which
India and any of the British colonies which may desire
to attend shall be represented, with a view to arrive,
if possible, at a common agreement on the basis above
indicated."</p>

<p>Such a report was claimed as a victory for either
side, but its doubtful tenor only confirmed the rooted<!-- Page 286 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
suspicion of the English administration as regards
any change of the currency system. And when, on
the occasion of the Paris Exhibition in 1889, a free
International Monetary Congress was held, as one of
the numerous special congresses connected with the
celebration, Great Britain was not represented among
the 194 members who attended on the invitation of the
organising committee. M. Magnin, governor of the
Bank of France, presided at the sittings, which covered
from the 11th to the 15th September. Like its
predecessor, the international conference, this congress
closed without direct or practical resolution.
Putting out of view this congress as of a more
informal nature, a period of eleven years elapsed
between the still only prorogued conference of Paris
of 1881 and the conference of Brussels in 1893.
This&mdash;as yet the last&mdash;conference was summoned on
the initiative of the United States, but from the
commencement a distinct difference of tone and
method made itself felt; the Government of the
United States recognising that some European
countries might not be willing to adopt the remedy
which they would prefer, namely, "the establishment
of some fixity of value between gold and silver, and
the free use of silver as a coin metal, upon a ratio to
gold to be fixed by an agreement between the great
commercial peoples of the world." The invitation to
and purpose of the conference were conveyed in quite
general terms, namely thus, "For the purpose of
considering what measures, if any, could be taken to<!-- Page 287 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
increase the use of silver in the currency systems of
nations."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE BRUSSELS CONFERENCE</i></div>

<p>The invitation was accepted by all the most
important states, and at the first meeting, on 26th November
1892, the delegates of twenty Governments
were present, namely, Austria, Hungary, Belgium,
Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, British
India, Greece, Italy, Mexico, The Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, Roumania, Russia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States.</p>

<p>The proceedings were opened by M. Beernaert,
President of the Council and Finance Minister of
Belgium. M. Montefiore Levi, senator, and delegate
of Belgium, was chosen as president, and his
Excellency, M. Edwin H. Terrell, Minister of
the United States at Brussels, and one of the
delegates of the United States, was chosen vice-president.</p>

<p>At the second meeting the American delegates
submitted a scheme for international bimetallism, but,
in conformity with the terms of the invitation, at the
same time expressed a hope that the powers represented
would consider and submit other plans for
the enlarged use of silver. Two such proposals they
themselves suggested for discussion&mdash;(1) the plan of
M. Moritz Levy, proposed at the conference of 1881,
and (2) the plan proposed by the late Dr. A. Soetbeer.
The main design of both these proposals was
to increase the use of silver, by substituting silver
<span class="correction" title="corrected from 'coin'">coins</span> or notes based on silver, for such small gold <!-- Page 288 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
coins and small notes based on gold as are at present
in circulation.</p>

<p>At the same session the delegates of Germany,
Austria, and Russia explained that they were instructed
not to express an opinion or to vote upon
any resolution. Roumania, Portugal, Turkey, and
Greece not having special instructions, felt themselves
compelled to take up a similar attitude. Finding
that France and the States of the Latin Union were
apparently more disposed to criticism of, rather than
to cordial co-operation with, the objects of the conference,
the delegates of the United States did not
press for a resolution on the wider question of bimetallism,
and the attention of the conference was
accordingly fixed on the subsidiary suggestions. To
these latter, as above, was added on the same day a
third, made by Mr. Alfred de Rothschild, to the effect
that on condition of the United States continuing
her purchases of 54 million oz. of silver yearly the
different European powers should combine to make
certain yearly purchases, say to the extent of
£5,000,000 yearly; these purchases to be continued
over a period of five years, at a price not
exceeding 43 pence per oz. On a rise of silver
above that price the purchases for the time being to
be immediately suspended.</p>

<p>In committee this latter proposal was thus
modified&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The European states which agree, upon the
basis of this proposal, will buy in each year 30<!-- Page 289 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
million oz. of silver, on condition that the United
States agree to continue their present purchases, and
that unlimited free coinage be maintained in British
India and Mexico.</p>

<p>2. The proportion of the purchases to be made by
each country will be determined by agreement.</p>

<p>3. The purchases will be made at the discretion
of and in the manner preferred by each Government.</p>

<p>4. These amounts of silver will be devoted in each
country to the monetary uses authorised by the
legislation of that state, and the silver will be either
coined or made the guarantee for an issue of ordinary
or special notes, as Government may think fit.</p>

<p>5. The arrangement will be made for five years.
The obligatory purchase of silver will be suspended
should the metal reach in the London market a price
determined by agreement between the Governments.
The purchases may be renewed, if the delegates of the
different countries interested should agree upon the
fixing of a new limit of price. They should be renewed
in any case if the price falls below the original
limit.</p>

<p>With regard to the Soetbeer plan it was abandoned
in committee, while the Levy plan was drawn up in
the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. The withdrawal from circulation within a
period of ... of gold coins containing a weight
of less than 5.806 grms. of fine gold (20-franc
pieces).</p>

<p>"2. The withdrawal of notes of a less value than<!-- Page 290 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
the coin of 20 francs or its equivalent, an exception
being made of notes representing a deposit of silver."</p>

<p>The manner of adopting and recommending
these schemes to the conference from the committee
was peculiar. The British delegate, Sir C. Fremantle,
declared that he could not entertain the "Levy" except
in conjunction with the "Rothschild" scheme, and
while recommending the latter to the conference for
discussion, the states of the Latin Union declared that
even if passed, they could not recommend the plan
to their Governments.</p>

<p>At the fourth session M. Boissevain declared that
there were insurmountable obstacles to its adoption
by the Government of the Netherlands. General
Strachey said that unless it received more favour
than was indicated by the report, he would be
unable to support it. Mr. Allard, one of the
Belgian delegates, declared that it was insufficient,
and Sir Rivers Wilson declared, on behalf of
himself and Sir Charles Fremantle, that recognising
that this want of support would prevent them
from recommending the plan to their Government,
they would refrain from taking part in a detailed
discussion of it, although they did not consider it
inconsistent with the monometallist opinions which
they held. Mr. M'Creary (delegate for the United
States), then stated that he did not consider M. de
Rothschild's proposal, as it stood, equitable to the
United States, and therefore that he would be unable
to support it.<!-- Page 291 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CLOSE OF THE BRUSSELS CONFERENCE</i></div>

<p>In view of the various declarations, M. de Rothschild
withdrew his plan, and there was left before
the conference only the Levy plan. This latter was
favourably regarded, but was radically insufficient for
the situation, and not considered important enough to
receive really vigorous support.</p>

<p>The course of the conference thereupon returned
to the general discussion of the bimetallic proposal of
the United States. In this discussion the attitude of
reserve which the French delegates had maintained
was abandoned, and M. Tirard declared with the
greatest clearness that he could not advise his
Government to open the French Mints to the free
coinage of silver, unless there was a general agreement
on the part of other nations to open their Mints
also. Until, therefore, there should be a decided
change of opinion on the part of Great Britain,
Germany, Austria, the Scandinavian States, and
other monometallic states, the question of returning
to the free coinage of silver must be looked upon as
settled.</p>

<p>In view of such declarations the delegates of the
United States declared that they would not press
for a vote upon the question of bimetallism. And
the conference closed with a formal adjournment,
should the Governments approve, to the 30th May
1893.</p>

<p>The close of the conference was a heavy blow to
the bimetallic cause, as illustrating so fully the impossibility
of any arrangement. Germany, Denmark,<!-- Page 292 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
Sweden, and Norway, declared clearly that no change
would be made on the gold basis of their currency.
The delegate of Austria Hungary was equally
explicit in his statement that his Government had
every intention of abiding by the gold standard they
were in the course of adopting.</p>

<p>The decided lead of France was followed
punctually by Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, and
Greece. The Netherlands were prepared to join a
bimetallic union, provided that Great Britain formed a
part of it; and Spain and Mexico were willing to
adopt bimetallism, or other measures which would
have the effect of raising the price of silver. No
declaration was made on the behalf of Russia,
though one of the delegates, speaking personally,
was an active supporter of the gold standard. The
Roumanian Government did not consider bimetallism
a practical possibility, and Turkey and Portugal
expressed no opinion.</p>

<p>Practically, the United States stood alone in
advocacy of bimetallism. In addition to this fact,
the situation was rendered much more trying for her
delegates by the fact that since their appointment
the presidential election had placed the Democratic
party in power, and great uncertainty prevailed as
to the attitude and intentions of a new President
and Congress. "In these circumstances it soon
became evident that the delegates were anxious
for an adjournment of the question to give the
new Government the opportunity of expressing<!-- Page 293 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
their views, and that the conference would adjourn
without any practical result. But, nevertheless,
some very important statements and declarations
were elicited in the course of the debates. In the
first place, in addition to the distinct declarations on
the part of some of the most important European
powers that they would not entertain bimetallism, the
representatives of the United States announced in
very clear language that at any moment their Government
might be disinclined to continue their purchases
of silver, and that they were determined to protect
their stock of gold. The Indian delegates alluded to
the possibility of their Government finding itself under
the necessity of closing its Mint to the free coinage
of silver."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GOLD STANDARD FOR INDIA</i></div>

<p>Already, before the calling of the Brussels Conference,
it had been recognised that, in case of failure to
arrive at a bimetallic agreement, it would be essential
thus far to close the Indian Mint, and to attempt the
establishment of a gold standard in India. This
impression, together with a draft scheme for a gold
currency, was conveyed in a minute of Sir David
Barbour's, addressed to the Secretary of State, 21st
June 1892. As the result of correspondence between
the Secretary of State for India in Council
and the Government of India the British Government,
on the 21st October 1892, <i>i.e.</i> a month before
the meeting of the Brussels Conference, nominated a
committee to consider the proposals submitted by the
Indian Government for stopping the free coinage of<!-- Page 294 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
silver in India, with a view to the introduction of a
gold standard.</p>

<p>The committee consisted of&mdash;The Lord High
Chancellor; The Right Hon. Leonard H. Courtney,
M.P.; Sir Thomas Henry Farrer, Bart.; Sir Reginald
Earle Welby, G.C.B.; Arthur Godley, Esq.,
C.B.; Lieutenant-General Richard Strachey, C.S.I.;
Bertram Wodehouse Currie, Esq.</p>

<p>A hope was at first expressed that the committee
would be able to make its report before the meeting
of the conference at Brussels. But it was not actually
made until the 31st May 1893.</p>


<h5>India.</h5>

<p>The part which India has played in the currency
history of the world has been <span class="correction" title="corrected from 'characterstic'">characteristic</span> and uniform
from the first. India is, and has been, from the birth
of international commerce, the receptacle or sink for
the precious metals of the civilised Western world.
The fact that in so being she has constituted herself
the safety-valve of the world's currencies is not
confined to the present day merely. It is peculiarly
applicable to the present day, with our organisation of
banking and credit, which has concentrated the
metallic reserves in certain burning central spots,
and built thereon a superstructure of credit transactions
so vast and in so delicately poised a manner that any
undue addition to the metallic reserve sends a shudder
of excitement and speculation through the whole,
inducing over-trading and over-funding, and in the <!-- Page 295 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
end a crisis. Such is the structure of the world's
commerce that India provides an outlet or drain for
any sudden crisis-bringing inflow of precious metal,
and preserves the equilibrium of our system. The
fact is patent to-day, because the nature of our credit
and banking system is understood. But in reality
this function India has performed through ages.</p>

<p>The influence she now exerts through impact
with a highly delicate credit system, she formerly
exerted on a less uniform and delicate system by the
rougher influence of prices generally. The gain
attending the Eastern trade in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries was not measured by modern
conceptions of dividends or trading margins. To
the European trader the intercourse was attended
with a double gain, commercial and financial&mdash;the
latter really bimetallic in nature from the higher ratio
then prevailing between silver and gold in India.</p>

<p>To India it meant a perpetual balance of trade in
her favour, if such a phrase can be used of such a
situation,&mdash;a continual inflow of precious metal. Her
capacity of absorption of metal seems as large and
unsatisfied as ever, and, on the assumption of an
unaltered situation in Europe and America, her
function in the world's currency system still remains&mdash;feasible
and beneficent. It is the most difficult
question attending the modern currency crisis,
whether such assumption of an unaltered situation
is permissible.</p>

<p>Further than this, as a simple matter of fact,<!-- Page 296 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
the currency difficulty with India at the present
moment is purely governmental and commercial.
The Indian Government has yearly to remit a very
large sum to this country in discharge of its gold obligations.
In 1873-74, before the great fall in silver
commenced, the amount remitted was £13,285,678,
which, at the rate of exchange of 1 rupee =
1s. 10.35d., meant 142,657,000 rupees. During the
year 1892-3 the amount remitted was £16,532,215,
which, at the average rate of exchange in that year,
1s. 2.985d., required a payment of 264,784,150 rupees.
If this could have been remitted at the exchange of
1873-74, it would only have needed 177,519,200
rupees, making a difference of 87,274,950 rupees.
The result of this is to turn what would be a surplus
of revenue into a large deficit. At an estimated
exchange of 1s. 4d. per rupee for the past year, a
surplus of revenue over expenditure was shown of
1,466,000 rupees. The exchange having fallen to an
average of rather less than 1s. 3d., this surplus has
been converted into an estimated deficit of 10,819,000
rupees. Notwithstanding the improvement of the
revenue by 16,533,000 rupees over the budget
estimate, the situation at the close of 1892 was
fraught with a double danger to the Indian Government.
The fall of silver&mdash;which had been such that
during the year exchange could scarcely be maintained
at 1s. 2 <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>d. for the rupee by the refusal to sell
bills in India below that rate&mdash;might still proceed.
And, secondly, in case of failure attending the <!-- Page 297 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
Brussels Conference, the United States would be inevitably
driven to abandon her single-handed attempt
to keep up the price of silver by her silver purchases.
In that case an unexampled fall of silver might be
expected. The only practical solution of the difficulty
was the adoption of a gold standard for India,
and in order to do so at a workable rate for the
rupee it would be necessary to anticipate such further
fall.</p>

<p>So much, in very brief, for the Government
situation. For the commercial,&mdash;the harassment of
trade by fluctuations of exchange, the check to
investments, the handicapping of the Lancashire
manufactures, and so on,&mdash;all this ground is still
strewn with the débris of debate and difference. As
far as the currency question, pure and simple, is
concerned&mdash;such, that is, as is conceived of throughout
this book, viz. metallic&mdash;it is almost incapable
of presentation or realisation. Through the extraordinary
preference of the Indian for the precious
metals as metals or as a commodity, quite apart
from currency use, the ordinary action of such
monetary laws as have been at work in Europe for
centuries is nullified&mdash;to how great an extent it is
quite impossible to estimate. The minting of silver
has been such as might be expected under the
conditions of free minting of a cheapening metal&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
it has risen on an average to the full amount of
the net imports of silver. But, conversely, there has
been no such reactionary influence of such mintings<!-- Page 298 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
on the gold store of the country as would have taken
place in Europe. The importations of silver have
gone hand in hand with a net importation, not
exportation, of gold, with no traceable evidence of
bimetallic action.</p>

<p>The establishment of the gold standard for India
is, therefore, primarily and in greatest part a
governmental measure. As far as relates to such
purely scientific phenomena and considerations, as
have governed the European currencies for centuries,

<h4>THE MONETARY SYSTEM OF FLORENCE
DURING THE DAYS OF HER COMMERCIAL
ACTIVITY AND INDEPENDENCE</h4>


<p>Throughout the history of independent Florence her gold
coin type is always the florin. In its first beginning her
monetary system had relation to that of the restored
Empire. The <i>silver fiorino</i> of which the first mention
occurs was equivalent to 12 denari, as in the Charlemagne
system. Presumably this would be equal to some hypothecated
<i>soldo</i>, and the multiple of it a hypothecated fiorino
d'oro, gold florin (= 20 soldi), would be equal to the lira or
libra, or unit of weight. This will explain how it is
possible to have mention of gold florins almost a century
before the actual issuing of a real coin so named. Such
mention occurs in the monetary ordinances and schedules
of France as early as 1180. (See Preface, <i>supra</i>, p. <a href="#Page_xiii">xiii</a>,
also De Saulcy, <i>Documents</i>, i. 115. Le Blanc was unable
to explain this apparent contradiction of history.)</p>

<p>What the particular Florentine weight unit or lira
(libbra) was, however, is uncertain. According to the<!-- Page 302 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
researches of Neri (in <i>Argelatus</i>, i. 157) the scheme of
weights was&mdash;</p>

<p>When it actually emerges, the gold florin has a weight
of 53 (English) grs., or 72 Florentine; which would
give a mark of 6912 grs. Its standard was of absolute
fineness, 24 carats, a standard which was never departed
from through the whole of its history. Very little change,
too, was made in the weight, hardly more than 4 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> grs. in
all (or 6 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> per cent.).</p>

<p>It was issued at an equivalence of 20 soldi, which were
represented by 20 silver florins, already known.</p>

<p>The variation of this coin with regard to the unit coin
of lower denomination will be found in the Table below.</p>

<p>There is a second variation of the gold florin, <i>apparently</i>
with regard to itself, which has given rise to much misunderstanding,
and requires explanation. As the process
of wear and tear and abrasion went on in the coins, with
lapse of time the custom grew of subdividing or hypothecating
a gold florin of ideally perfect weight and condition
as the standard for transactions. This became book or
bank money, and the actually circulating medium was rated
to it at a certain discount. This ideal florin is known as
<i>fiorini di suggello</i> or <i>sigillo</i>, florin of the public seal, and
there is a series of such denominations. The first apparent
adoption of such a method&mdash;which also emerges in the
currency history of Hamburg and Amsterdam&mdash;was in

sigello"; the second was in 1324, the third in 1345, and so
on. Between the years 1328 and 1462 there was a series
of eight, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Subsequently, by law of 30th May 1464, this various
advantage was transferred from the <i>fiorini di suggello</i> to a
new denomination, <i>fiorini d'oro larghi</i>, with an advantage of
20 per cent. above the <i>fiorini di suggello</i>; and once again,
by the law of 14th October 1501, the process was repeated.
An advantage of 19 per cent. over the <i>fiorini d'oro larghi</i>
was announced in favour of the newest denomination,
<i>fiorini d'oro larghi in oro</i>. The advantage of these last,
therefore, over the <i>fiorini di suggello</i> of 1461 amounted to
39 per cent.</p>

<p>It appears quite clear that this advantage represents a
differentiation, not of good bank abstract florins from worn
current gold florins, but of the former from the actual
current medium of payment, and that this latter was <i>silver</i>.</p>

<p>The cause of the advantage was the depreciation of the
silver denomination, from the aggregate of which was
formed the lira, in which was expressed the value of the
gold florin.<a name="FNanchor_23_27" id="FNanchor_23_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_27" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
<!-- Page 304 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>For illustration:&mdash;</p>


<p>In 1464&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote><p>120 fiorini di suggello = 100 fiorini
    d'oro larghi at 4 lire 8 sol. 4 den.
    each                 = 530 lire.</p></blockquote>

  <blockquote><p>Therefore each fiorino d'oro largo
  ought to = 5 lire 6 sol., which by the
  tables of the time it actually did.</p></blockquote>

<p>Similarly, in 1501&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote><p>100 fiorini larghi d'oro in oro = 119
    larghi di grossi at 5 lire 11 sol.
    4 den.                             = 660 lire.</p></blockquote>

  <blockquote><p>Therefore fiorino largo d'oro in oro
    should = 6 lire 12 sol. which it
    actually did.</p></blockquote>


<p>The <span class="smcap">silver monies</span> of Florence were based on the
silver florin =  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">20</span> of gold florin (= 38 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> grains).</p>

<p>From the time of the Mint Law of 1296, these silver
coins are styled <i>grossi</i>, and subsequently <i>soldi</i>, <i>grossi</i>, <i>Guelfi</i>,
etc. etc.</p>

<p>The alloy gradually sank&mdash;</p>

<p>remaining at the last-named figure until the reopening of
the Pisan Mint in 1597.</p>

<p>As the gold rose in value by the process already
indicated, and the idea of the lira as 20 soldi = 1 gold
florin, became inapplicable, the lira came to be looked on as
a fractional part of the gold piece or florin. This usage
grew up in Florence from the beginning of the twelfth
century, and so continued till the days of Cosimo <span class="smcap">I.</span>, who
in 1534 coined the first lira, <i>i.e.</i> an actual silver coin.</p>

<p>This imaginary lira of mediæval Florence was itself
divided, like the florin, into soldi and denari, similar aliquot
parts. Hence the custom of keeping Florentine accounts,
(1) <i>a oro</i>, or (2) <i>a moneta di piccioli</i>, the one in terms of the
florin of gold, the other in terms of the imaginary lira.</p>

<p>The confusion to which this led was due to the unstable
nature of the imaginary money, which from 1312 continually
depreciates in value, as compared with the actual hard
florin money. In 1314, as some measure of reform, it was
ordained that the florin of gold should not equal more nor
less than 29 of the soldi of this lira, and that it should
never change from such course&mdash;the distinction of <i>moneta
bianca</i> and <i>nera</i> being introduced for the purpose. The
ceasing of the observation of this regulation in the sixteenth
century made way for every kind of confusion.</p>

<p>For the explanation of the text in Part <span class="smcap">I.</span>, pp. <a href="#Page_19">19</a>-<a href="#Page_23">23</a>, it
need only be added that 20 of these imaginary soldi formed
the <i>lira a fiorino</i> spoken of.<!-- Page 306 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_II" id="APPENDIX_II"></a>APPENDIX   II</h2>

<h4>THE MONETARY SYSTEM OF VENICE</h4>


<p>The Venetian monetary system of history employed a
double basis or unit:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <i>lira di piccioli</i>, the principal system, and the one
which endured through the whole life of the Republic,
from the tenth century to the introduction of the decimal
system in 1806.</p>

<p>2. The <i>lira di grossi</i>&mdash;an ideal system, <i>i.e.</i> money of
accompt only, and of importance for a much less extensive
period. It originated in the thirteenth century, and was
abandoned by the end of the sixteenth.</p>

<p>The "lira" of the first of these systems is derived from
the "libra" of Charlemagne, and, like it, was divided into
20 soldi, each soldo being subdivided into 12 denari.</p>

<p>For long the only coin actually minted was this denaro
(<i>parvus</i>, <i>parvulus</i>, <i>piccolo</i> or <i>minuto</i>), a silver coin. The
first of these thus issued appertain entirely to the system
of the Empire of Charlemagne. They bear the name of
Louis the Pious (814-40), and approximate in weight to
his pieces. The dismemberment of Charlemagne's Empire
is followed by a gap in the Venetian coinage, and the<!-- Page 311 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
series only recommences in the eleventh century. These
latter still appertain to the system of the revived Roman
(Germanic) Empire, and bear the names of Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span>
(1002-24), Conrad <span class="smcap">II.</span> (1027-39), and Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span>
(1056-1106).</p>

<p>From this latter date onwards the imperial monies cease
at Venice, and the series of Ducal monies&mdash;the monies of
the republic of Venice&mdash;begin with the Dogeship of
Vitale <span class="smcap">II.</span> (1156-72). From the same period there is
noticeable that deterioration in weight which marks all
the systems of mediæval Europe. The denari of Doge
Sebastiano Ziani (1172-8) and of the two succeeding
Doges are scarcely one-quarter the weight of the Charlemagne
denarius.</p>

<p>This depreciation led, in the year 1200, to the issue of a
piece of higher denomination, namely, the <i>grosso</i>&mdash;still a
silver coin, but valued at 26 piccioli or denari; and for
about seventy years the grosso displaced the picciolo.
About 1270, however, the coining of the picciolo recommenced
under Doge Lorenzo Tiepolo, but at a slightly
reduced value, 28 piccioli being rated to the grosso, instead
of 26 as in the year 1200. Up to the great recoinage
of 1476 the grosso remains the main coin of reference.
Its gradual but incessant depreciation can be traced in the
table of silver coins given on p. <a href="#Page_318">318</a>.</p>

<p>Under the eleventh doge, Giovanni Dandolo (1280-89),
the coining of gold began in Venice. In 1284, the date of
the first issue, the gold ducat or sequin (zecchino) of Venice
was valued at 18 grossi, giving a ratio of gold to silver of
10.6. The subsequent changes of the ratio have already<!-- Page 312 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
been stated (see text, <i>supra</i>, p. <a href="#Page_40">40</a>). From 1282, 67
ducats were coined from the Venetian mark. This
number was increased in 1491 to 67 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>, and in 1570
to 68 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>. The course of the sequin throughout is given
in the table on p. <a href="#Page_316">316</a>. It was the monetary trouble which
they produced that led to the great recoinage accomplished
under Doge Nicolo Tron (1471-73) and his
successors, Nicolo Marcello (1473-74) and Pietro Mocenigo
(1474-76).</p>

<p>From the date of this recoinage onwards the silver
grosso was abolished <i>as a coin</i>, and a new silver coin, the
lira, valued at 20 soldi, was instituted. This is the first
appearance of a real and effective lira as a coin. Hitherto
the name had only been that of a weight. By the decree
of 1472, 36 of these lira were to be coined out of the mark
of silver.</p>

<p>On account of the name of the doge this coin was
known as the <i>Lira Tron</i> for centuries. In its turn it
underwent a ceaseless depreciation (see table on p. <a href="#Page_318">318</a>).</p>

<p>In the middle of the sixteenth century there was
so much silver in the Venetian Mint waiting to be
coined for the merchants that the State, finding it
could only issue 35,000 pieces a month, which, in small
pieces of 442 soldi, would take a year to exhaust the
stock, determined for the ease and encouragement of
the merchants to issue a large silver piece, the <i>ducato
d'argento</i>, 7 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> to the mark of silver by tale, and rated at
124 soldi.</p>

<p>Under Doge Nicoló da Ponte (1578-85) this piece<!-- Page 313 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
becomes the <i>scudo d'argento</i>, which begins in 1578 with an
equivalence of 7 lira.</p>

<p>On this basis the monetary system of Venice continued
till the seizing of the Mint by the Democrats in
1797.</p>

<p>For several years, during which they held possession,
they issued a coin called <i>Tollero</i>, of the nominal value of 10
Venetian lire, <i>i.e.</i> 5.16 Italian lire, but really only equal to
4.99 of the latter.</p>

<p>In 1802 the Italian Republic was erected by Buonaparte.
The monetary law of the Republic, dated 30th April
1804, provided for the coining of a national money on a
unit or basis of the silver lira, of the weight established by
the law of 27th October 1803, namely, 4 deniers, and
of .9 standard.</p>

<p>In 1805 Napoleon declared himself King of Italy, but
the change was not followed by any radical revolution of
the coinage system.</p>

<p>From 1806 the decimal system was introduced into
Italy, and on the reduction of the numerous independent
monetary systems the Venetian lira was computed at .5116
of the Italian, <i>i.e.</i> 51.16 centesimi.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, however, the Venetian lira did not
totally thereupon disappear from use.</p>

<p>By decree of December 21, 1807, the ducat (zecchino)
of 67 <span class="above">47</span>&#8260;<span class="below">41</span> Venetian grs. was rated at 12.03 lire Italiane.</p>

<p>Under the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, which succeeded,
the main Italian monies were assimilated to those
of Austria. The money of account was, at Milan, the
Austrian lira (= 100 centesimi = 20 Austrian soldi at 5
centesimi each).</p>

<p>There remains to be described the second and less
important basis of the Venetian system, that of the
lira di grossi. It was throughout&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> from the thirteenth
century, when it originated, to the close of the sixteenth,
when it disappeared&mdash;an ideal system, <i>i.e.</i> of account
only.</p>

<p>A supposititious lira di grossi was taken and divided
into 40 soldi, each soldo was subdivided into 12
denari, and each one of these denari was equivalent to
the grosso, the actual coin existing in the system&mdash;already
described.</p>

<p>The lira di grossi therefore maintained at first the same
relativity to the lira di piccioli that the actual grosso did to
the actual picciolo, namely, 26:1. This relation, however<!-- Page 315 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
changed subsequently with the depreciation of the actual
grosso (the lira).</p>

</table></div>

<p>A curious feature about this system was that in its turn
it subdivides. In 1343 a double (hypothetical) grosso was
adopted; one of 48 piccioli, the other of 32, both of them
subdivided into thirty-two parts as, again, an ideal system.</p>

<p>In 1472, therefore, the Venetian silver system consisted
of&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Lira di piccioli</i>, an actual coin represented by the
Troni, and containing 128 grs. of silver, .9472 fine.</p>

<p>2. The ideal <i>lira di grossi</i>, then equivalent to 10 ducats,
divided into 20 ideal soldi, each equivalent to  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-ducat, each
soldo again subdivided in 12 grossi, the grosso being now
no longer the actual coin of that name but ideal, like the
above multiples; and each grosso in its turn subdivided into
32 parts, to which the name of <i>piccioli</i> was given, though as
ideal as its multiple the grosso. For distinction's sake
probably, these ideal grossi and piccioli occur in history as
<i>grossi a oro</i> and <i>piccioli a oro</i>.<!-- Page 316 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_III" id="APPENDIX_III"></a>APPENDIX III</h2>

<h4>THE MONETARY SYSTEM OF SPAIN</h4>


<p>The monetary system of Christian Spain dates from the
Gothic invasions, and differs from that of Germany, Italy,
and France in being derived in the first place from the
Roman system without the intermediation of that of
Charlemagne.</p>

<p>Under the Goths the monetary basis was the Roman
libra, subdivided thus&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
1 libra = 8 onzas = 4608 grs.<br />
1 onza = 8 ochavas = 576 grs.<br />
1 ochava = 6 tomines = 72 grs.<br />
1 tomin = 3 quilates or siliqua = 12 grs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The unit denomination was the sueldo de oro (gold
sueldo) =  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">6</span> onza of the fineness of 23 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> quilates (=.989
fine), corresponding exactly to the Roman <i>aureus</i> of the
times of Julian.</p>

<p>The unit denomination of the silver money was twofold&mdash;(1)
the silver <i>sueldo</i> (=  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">6</span> onza like the gold), and (2) the
<i>denario</i> ( <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> onza or ochava). The silver coins were at first
of 12 dineros fine, but subsequently only <i>10.12</i> (=.875 fine).<!-- Page 320 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>Of these two units, the latter, the silver denario was
far the more usual and frequent in use.</p>

<p>With one important change of name, and infinite
change of incident and detail, it was this system which
obtained till the great reform of the Spanish monetary
system under Ferdinand and Isabella.</p>

<p>The change of name consists in the introduction of that
of the <i>maravedi</i>, which was adopted from the conquered
Moors, and applied to designate the sueldo d'oro from the
time of the conquest of Toledo.</p>

<p>In a comprehensive way it may be said that the
history of this word or name, maravedi, sums up the
monetary history of Spain. From being the original gold
coin of highest denomination, it came to be a silver coin,
then a billon coin of the very lowest denomination, as it is
to-day. The process of its degeneration is quite unexampled
even in Europe. In addition, also, to the
confusion of idea produced by this depreciation there is a
further uncertainty, caused by the quite general use of the
word or name, <i>i.e.</i> not as the name of a particular coin or
money series, but perfectly generally for almost any and
every coin&mdash;as synonymous, in fact, with the simple word
money itself.</p>

<p>Neglecting this latter question, however, as one of
nomenclature merely, the course of depreciation of the
maravedi may be thus illustrated:&mdash;</p>

<p>Maravedi (Moorish coin), fine gold, about 56 grs. By
the time of James I. of Aragon, the contents in fine gold
had sunk to 14 grs.<!-- Page 321 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>Having been still further reduced to 10 grs. under
Alfonso the Wise, it was made into a silver coin, as being too
small to be expressed in gold.</p>

<p>Its depreciation in this latter form and through its third
form of billon money was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>To return. At the time of its adoption by the Christian
powers of Spain, the maravedi (or sueldo de oro) was equal
to  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">6</span> onza of gold.</p>

<p>To this maravedi de oro was subsequently given the
name of <i>Alfonsi</i>, supposititiously from Alfonso <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, the first
to issue them.</p>

<p>The first important change in this monetary system of
Gothic Spain&mdash;though one of detail rather than system&mdash;was
effected by Ferdinand <span class="smcap">II.</span> of Leon, who, in 1157, coined
the silver <i>leones</i> of the value of half the silver sueldo (= 12
dineros).</p>

<p>In 1222 S. Ferdinand introduced the <i>sueldo pepiones</i>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sueldo de oro = 10 metales or mitgales, 1 metale = 18 pepiones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But both these importations were suppressed by Alfonso
<span class="smcap">X.</span>, the Wise, of Castile.<!-- Page 322 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1252 he coined his <i>maravedis blancos</i>, or <i>Burgaleses</i>,
to replace the sueldos pepiones.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">6 dineros = 1 sueldo,</span><br />
15 sueldos = 1 maravedi Burgalese.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This maravedi bore the ratio of 1: 6 to the old
maravedi de oro.</p>

<p>This money (Burgalese) was subsequently known as
<i>moneda viejo</i>, <i>maravedis viejos</i>, or <i>moneda blanca</i>.</p>

<p>Six years after its introduction, however, Alfonso
demonetised his own Burgaleses to make room for his
<i>maravedises negros</i>, or <i>prietos</i>, a money of billon which
lasted till the days of Ferdinand and Isabella.</p>

<p>Twenty-three years later Alfonso issued a second
"white money" (1281), so called as distinguished from the
Burgaleses, mention of which recur.</p>

<p>To the "second white" (<i>blanco segundo</i>) was also given
the (commoner) name of new (<i>novenes</i>). It was issued at
one-fourth the value of the <i>prietos</i>. The relationship of the
novenes to the prietos and to the standard (now supposititious)
gold maravedi is thus expressed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>15 dineros prietos = 1 maravedi,<br/>
Old maravedi = 75 sueldos,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&there4; 1 prieto = 5 sueldos.<br/>
Old maravedi = 60 maravedis novenes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&there4; 1 prieto = 4 maravedis novenes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under Alfonso the Wise, therefore, the system was as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>10 dineros = 1 noveno,<br/>
 4 novenes = 1 maravedi de los prietos (= 5 sueldos of 8 dineros each).<br/>
10 novenes = 1 maravedi de los Burgaleses.<br/>
60 novenes = 1 old maravedi.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 323 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>These <i>novenes</i>, or <i>maravedis blancos segundos</i>, continued
current through the fourteenth century, and in the
laws of John <span class="smcap">III.</span> are spoken of as "maravedises of our
present currency," and as still =  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">10</span> of the maravedises
Burgaleses, which latter are spoken of as "maravedises of
good currency" (<i>maravedis de los buenos</i>).</p>

<p>But by the close of the fourteenth century, owing to the
depreciation of the currency, the novenes had come to be
looked upon as of better denomination than the then
current coin, and are accordingly spoken of as "old"
(<i>viejos</i>) for distinction's sake.</p>

<p>The only material additions to this system of Alfonso
the Wise were briefly&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <i>coronados</i>, an innovation of his successor,
Sancho <span class="smcap">IV.</span> (1284-95), who, in 1286, introduced them as
= 1 old dinero. They subsequently appear as <i>cornados</i>.</p>

<p>In the Cortes of Toledo their relation to the novenes
was thus determined:&mdash;</p>

<p>
6 coronados = 10 novenes = 1 maravedi de moneda vieja (= Burgaleses).<br />
</p>

<p>2. The series of gold coins initiated by Alfonso <span class="smcap">XI.</span>
(1302-50).</p>

<p>It was in the reign of this latter King that the general
movement of adoption of gold coinage first touched Spain.
The earliest gold coins were Alfonso's <i>doblas</i>, subsequently
known as <i>castellanos</i>. The weight of this coin has been
variously assigned as 48 to a mark or 50 or 51.</p>

<p>Taking the tale of 50 to the mark, the weight per piece
would be 92 <span class="above">4</span>&#8260;<span class="below">25</span> grms. (= 4.60090 grms.) of 23 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> quilates
fine (= .989 fine).</p>

<p>Pedro <span class="smcap">I.</span> made gold doblas of the weight of 90 grs., and<!-- Page 324 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
this endured till the days of John <span class="smcap">I.</span>, 1379-90, who
preserved the same weight but lowered the standard.
Under Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> the standard of 23 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> quilates was again
restored. For the movement of the gold coins subsequent
to Ferdinand and Isabella, see the <a href="#Page_326">Table</a>.</p>

<p>3. The silver <i>real</i> first appears under Pedro <span class="smcap">I.</span>,
1350-69. It was issued at a tale of 66 to a mark, and
11 dineros 4 grs. fine.</p>

<p>Under Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span> of Castile, 1369-79, these reals
undergo extraordinary debasement, the standard being
reduced to .279, .129, .060, and so on; but a recovery took
place under his successor, John <span class="smcap">I.</span>, 1379-90, who returned
to the standard of Pedro <span class="smcap">I.</span>, substituting for the debased
real his own vellon money, under the titles of <i>blancos</i>
and <i>Agnus Dei</i>, a money known later as <i>blancas</i> and
<i>maravedises de moneda blanca</i>.</p>

<p>The restorer of the Spanish coinage was, however, not
John so much as his son, Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span>, 1390-1406. By his
ordinance of 21st January 1391, issued at the instance of
the Cortes of Madrid, 1390, the blancos of John <span class="smcap">I.</span> were
reduced in equivalence to 1 coronado. Gold coins were
restored to the tale and standard of Alfonso <span class="smcap">XI.</span>, and the
silver real to those of Pedro <span class="smcap">I.</span></p>

<p>The vellon money, however, of this reign&mdash;the blancos
in particular&mdash;present a confusion which has hitherto baffled
the most learned. It has been computed that one hundred
and thirty-two monies of various denominations circulated
in Castile under this King.</p>

<p>In brief, the system from his day till the time of
Ferdinand and Isabella may be thus tabularly expressed:&mdash;<!-- Page 326 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"><span class="correction" title="page 325 appears to be a continuation of page 326. Pages flipped.">[Pg 326]</span></a></span></p>

<p>The reign of John <span class="smcap">II.</span> (1406-54) marks a period of
exceeding confusion, coupled with inefficient attempts at
legislative remedy. The disorder of his reign was further
increased under his successor, Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span> (1454-74), years
which represent the apogee of Spanish depreciation. By
grants of the right of private minting the six official Spanish
Mints were increased to not less than 150, with a resulting
monetary disorder, dearness of necessaries, and commercial
panic which it would be difficult to estimate. The gold
monies varied in fineness from 23 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>, 19, 18, 17, and so on,
even to 7 quilates, and the same extraordinary variations
marked the silver monies. Of billon monies there were
eight distinct classes, representing a succession of fractional
parts of the silver real,  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">6</span>,  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">7</span>,  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>,  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">12</span>,  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">16</span>,  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">22</span>,  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">24</span>,  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">58</span>.</p>

<p>Taking, for the mere purpose of generalisation or average,
the gold <i>Enrique</i> of this reign at a tale of 50 to a mark,
23 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> quilates fine, and the silver real (= 30 maravedis de
blancas) at a tale of 67 to a mark, and standard of 11.4
fine, the ratio of gold to silver for the reign would be
9.824:1.</p>

<p>The monetary situation which the advent of the Catholic
kings, Ferdinand and Isabella (1475-1506), was to alleviate
and reform was the most deplorable that Spain has ever
seen. Not less than eleven ordinances of reform were issued
before the close of the century. For practical purposes only
the first and last of these require notice. By the Mint indenture,
issued on the 26th June 1475 to the Mint master of
Seville, the gold coinage was ordered on the following basis:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Excellentes (at a tale of 25 to a mark, 23 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> quilates fine, in
value = to 2 castellanos).</p></blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 328 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>And silver on the following basis:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Silver Reals (at a tale of 67 to a mark, 11 din. 4 grs. fine,
in value equal to 30 maravedis).</p></blockquote>

<p>First and chiefest importance, however, attaches to the
ordinance of 1497, issued at Medino del Campo, and so
named. By this ordinance all the previous existing systems
and monies were abrogated, and a new system instituted
which forms the starting-point for the monetary history of
that Spain which was to be the receiver and distributor of
the gold and silver of the New World.</p>

<p>The standard of gold was fixed at 23 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> quilates. The
basis of the gold coins was to be the <i>excellente de la
Granada</i>, issued at an equivalence of two of the antecedent
excellentes, and at a tale of 65 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> to the mark.</p>

<p>The system of the silver real was as in 1475, but it
was issued at an equivalence of 34 maravedis, at which it
ever after remained.</p>

<p>The billon money was to consist of <i>blancas</i> (7 grs. fine,
and at a tale of 192 to a mark).</p>

<tr><td></td><td align="left">1 real</td><td>"</td><td align="right">34 maravedis.</td></tr>

</div>

<p>The changes subsequently effected in this system may be
presented in skeleton form (see also accompanying Tables).</p>

<p>In 1523 the Cortes of Valladolid presented a petition
referring to the changed relation of the two metals, and
asking for a recoining on a different ratio. Its proposals
were incorporated in the ordinance of 1537, when the
scheme was as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><!-- Page 329 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>Under Philip <span class="smcap">II.</span>, by the ordinance of 23rd November
1566, the equivalence of the gold coins was increased a
seventh, the silver monies being again left untouched. The
increase was partly arbitrary and unprincipled, partly due
to the normally prevailing depreciation of silver.</p>

<p>Under Philip <span class="smcap">III.</span> the intrinsic value or content of the
gold monies was decreased  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">10</span>, silver being again left intact.</p>

<p>The innumerable calamities which overtook Spain under
Philip <span class="smcap">IV.</span> (1621-65) and Charles <span class="smcap">II.</span> (1665-1750) led to an
immense introduction of billon money, to so great an extent,
indeed, that it fell to one-eighth its previous value, thereby
only complicating and increasing the evils. The result was
an increasing premium on good monies, coupled with the
usual disappearance of them. By the proclamation of 8th
March 1625 it was prohibited, on severest penalties, to
carry such premium above 10 per cent.; by the succeeding
proclamations of 30th April 1636 and 7th September 1641
this limit was raised respectively to 25 per cent, and 50
per cent.</p>

<p>Philip <span class="smcap">IV.</span> also instituted the first change in the silver
system which it underwent since the great reform of 1497.</p>

<p>The tale was increased from 67 to 83 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> per mark, the
<i>real of eight</i> being henceforth issued at an equivalence of 10
reals.</p>

<p>This change was equivalent to a reduction of 25 per
cent. in the silver monies.</p>

<p>Under Charles <span class="smcap">II.</span> this corruption proceeded in an
ascending scale until 1680, when the gold <i>doblon</i> had
arrived at an equivalence of 110 reals of billon, and the
<i>real of eight</i> to 29 reals of billon.<!-- Page 330 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>By the law of 14th October 1686 an attempt was
made to re-create and reform the tottering system. The
mark of silver (11 din. 4 grs. fine) was to be coined at a tale
of 84 pieces. The real of eight received a new name,
<i>Escudo de plata</i>, and was to issue at an equivalence of
10 reals of the new silver.</p>

<p>The effect of this apparent reform was to lower the
weight of the silver money 25 per cent., to incorporate the
premium of 50 per cent. on the billon money, and to institute
or sanction a matter of four separate monetary units:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1. The real of old silver =  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">67</span> mark.<br />
2. The real of new silver =  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">84</span> mark.<br />
3. The real of billon =  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">126</span> mark.<br />
4. The real of billon =  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">38</span> of the double escudo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the close of the reign the monetary system was as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Philip <span class="smcap">V.</span> was for many years prevented by the enormous
expenditure caused by the revolt of Don Carlos from reform
of this system, which he ultimately undertook and carried
out. In 1707 he reduced the standard of silver to 10
dineros, of a tale of 75 reals to the mark, creating the money
which is distinguished thenceforward by the name of <i>Plata
provincial</i>.<!-- Page 331 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>By the regulation of 9th June 1728 the series of <i>Plata
nacional</i> was lowered to 11 dineros fine (= .917) and a
tale of 68 reals.</p>

<p>Of more importance was the Mint regulation of 16th
July 1730, by which&mdash;</p>

<p>This ideal system could not be retained, as the billon
money fell within a short time a matter of 5 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> per cent. in
relation to it. The latter change was incorporated by the
proclamation of 16th May 1737, which fixed the silver
<i>escudo</i> of 10 reals (the old piece of 8 reals) at 170 cuartos,
equivalent to the 20 reals of billon at which it continued
to be valued. By the subsequent Mint order of 22nd June
1742 the attempt was made to bring the billon money into
exact relationship with the gold by the coining of gold
pieces equal to 20 reals billon (<i>veintenes</i>) struck at a tale of
128 per mark, and fineness of 21 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> quilates, in place of the
previously existing standard of 22 quilates.</p>

<p>These veintenes correspond to the escudos of 21 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> reals
still to be found in circulation.</p>

<p>No change of any importance was effected under the
short reign of Ferdinand <span class="smcap">VI.</span> (1746-59), under whom the
custom inaugurated by Philip <span class="smcap">V.</span> of expressing values in reals
of billon rather than of silver (<i>plata provincial</i>) still continued.<!-- Page 332 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>His successor, however, Charles <span class="smcap">III.</span> (1759-88) effected
profound reforms. By the ordinance of 29th May 1772
he accomplished a complete recoinage of the Spanish money.
The standards he established were&mdash;</p>

<p>The bearing of this change on the question of the ratio
at large in Europe has been already referred to. It was
again and still further for the protection of gold that the
seigniorage was increased to 7.48 per cent. by the law of
17th July 1779. The later system established in 1786
(see Tables <i>postea</i>) has a similar bearing.</p>

<p>His son, Charles <span class="smcap">IV.</span> (1789-1808), made no alteration in
this latter system of Charles <span class="smcap">III.</span></p>

<p>Under Ferdinand <span class="smcap">VII.</span> (1808-32) currency was given
(1813-1823) to French gold and silver monies on a certain
footing, and the seigniorage on the coins was reduced. Both
under Ferdinand, however, and under his successor, Isabella
<span class="smcap">II.</span> (1832-61), this latter regulation proved ineffectual in
attracting merchants to bring the metals to the Mint to be
coined; and under the circumstances the circulation of
French Napoleons was considered a benefit. A profound
alteration was projected by the two laws of 1834; the<!-- Page 333 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
first of which proposed to lower the equivalence of the <i>real</i>
to 32 from 34 maravedis, and the standard of silver to 10
dineros 12 granos (=.875), and the second, to prevent the
circulation of French money. This scheme was intentionally
bimetallic. It failed, however, of accomplishment, and the
monetary system remained as before up to 1847.</p>

<p>By the decree of 31st May 1847&mdash;(1) the decimal
division of the real was adopted; (2) the weight of the real
was established at 25 granos and standard at .900; (3) a
new gold coin of 100 reals of the weight of 161 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> granos of
the same alloy was introduced.</p>

<p>This system was of course a reproduction of that of
France; but in the following year it underwent slight
alteration, as already related. By the law of 1st January
1859 the French metrical system was adopted in its entirety
by Spain, and since 1st January 1876 Spain reckons in
pesetas (representing the French franc) and centesimos
(representing the French centime)&mdash;100 centesimos = 1
peseta. The new gold coins are pieces of 5, 10, 20, and
other multiples of the peseta. The peseta (5 grms. silver,
.835 fine) is token money, but the 5-peseta pieces (25 grms.
silver, .900 fine) are legal tender.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>5 pesetas = 1 duro ("hard dollar," "Spanish dollar," or piastre).<br/>
1 duro    = 2 escudos.<br/>
1 escudo  = 10 reals.<br/>
1 real    = 34 maravedis.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_IV" id="APPENDIX_IV"></a>APPENDIX IV</h2>

<h4>THE MONETARY SYSTEM OF THE
NETHERLANDS</h4>

<p>In its earliest known form the Netherlands monetary
system reproduces those features of the Carlovingian
system which reappear alike in Italy, France, and England.</p>

<p>The ideal Flemish pound was divided into 20 schellingen,
the schelling into 12 grooten.</p>

<p>This was entirely an ideal system; the actual coins
being, at first, the silver denarius, divided into obols. This
ideal system of pounds, schellings, and groots survived in
Flanders and the Southern Netherlands (now the kingdom
of Belgium) long after it had been superseded in the
Northern Provinces (the United Netherlands) by another
equally ideal system, that of the gulden and stiver.</p>

<p>According to this latter system the Flemish pound was
divided into 6 gulden, the gulden into 20 stivers. As
between the two systems, therefore, the Northern gulden
was equal to 3 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> Southern schellings, and the Northern
stiver to 2 Southern groots.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of the stivers occurs in 1355, but<!-- Page 346 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
it was a considerable time before the new system displaced
the old one in the Northern Provinces, and the reckoning
by schellings and groots as well as, or alongside of, that by
gulden and stivers occurs in Holland even as late as the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p>The weight system employed for the precious metals
was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
1 pound troy         =        2 marks.<br/>
1 mark               =        8 oz.<br/>
1 oz.                =       20 engels.<br/>
1 engel              =       32 azen.<br/>
<br/>
So that 160 engels or 5120 azen made up the mark.
</p></blockquote>

<p>In reckoning the standard or alloy, the weight system
was&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
For silver&mdash;1 mark  =  12 pfennige or deniers.<br/>
For silver&mdash;1 mark    = 288 grs. (12 x 24).<br/>
For gold&mdash;1 mark    =  24 carats.<br/>
For gold&mdash;1 mark    = 288 grs. (24 x 12).<br/>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Although forming part of the Holy Roman Empire
(being included in the Burgundian Circle), the Mint system
of the Empire has apparently never obtained in the
Netherlands. The Counts of Holland, from the days of
Floris II. and Jan I. (<i>i.e.</i> from 1256 onwards) have minted
on their own account, as have also the Counts of Flanders
from a much more remote date. The silver <i>deniers</i> of the
Counts of Flanders date from at least the days of Count
Arnold II. (964-989). The introduction of "la grosse
monnaie" (whence gros and groots), in imitation of the
French money, dates from the reign of Marguerite, Countess
of Flanders (1244-1280), or possibly earlier; and the gold
coinage (<i>royaux</i>, in imitation of those of Philip the Long of<!-- Page 347 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
France, and <i>florins</i>, in imitation of those of Florence) dates
from Count Louis de Crécy (1322-1346).</p>

<p>The interest, however, attaching to the monies of the
Counts of Flanders and Holland up to the close of the
fifteenth century is prevailingly numismatic, as, in the
absence of a continuous series of Mint indentures, it is a
matter of almost insuperable difficulty to construct tables of
the coins. The chief indications are contained in the tariffs
already referred to (<i>supra</i>, text, pp. <a href="#Page_79">79</a>-<a href="#Page_83">83</a>), but their testimony
bears more expressly on exchange rates rather than
upon Mint rate and standard.</p>

<p>The table of the groot, according to this source, is as
follows:&mdash;</p>




<div class="center">

<p>The foundations of a national Mint, or monetary system
for the Netherlands, were first laid by the ordinance issued by
the Emperor Maximilian at Breda on the 14th December 1489.</p>

<p>According to this ordinance the gold <i>double florin</i> was
to be struck at a tale of 44 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> to the mark Troy, of a fineness
of 23 <span class="above">7</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> carats, and issued at an equivalence of 80 gros.</p>

<p>The remaining gold coins were to comprise the <i>St.
Andries florin</i> = 40 groschen (and its half); while the silver
coins were to comprise&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
Gros               =   1 gros.<br/>
Pattart            =   2 gros.<br/>
Double pattart     =   4 gros.<br/>
Grand double       =   8 gros.<br/>
</p></blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 348 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>In great part this is to be regarded as an ideal or
unrealised system. The first effectual regulation of the
silver coinage was made in the ordinance of Charles V. of
22nd February 1542.</p>

<p>This ordinance prescribed the minting of the silver
<i>carolus</i>, in imitation of the Dutch thaler.</p>

<p>The practical effect of this measure, therefore, was to
introduce a coin equal to, and therefore representative of,
the hitherto fictitious or merely ideal <i>gulden</i>.</p>

<p>The remaining tariffs of the succeeding hundred years
or so, together with the bimetallic experience of the Netherlands,
have been already briefly described in the text
(<i>supra</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_71">71</a>, <a href="#Page_77">77</a>). On the declaration of independence by
the Northern Provinces, and the separation of the United
Netherlands from the Southern or Spanish Netherlands,
which succeeded, the monetary history of these two portions
of the Low Countries bifurcates.</p>

<p>We are here concerned only with that of the Northern
or United or Dutch Provinces, as being of more commercial
interest in European history of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries.</p>

<p>By Article 12 of the Union, each of the seven United
Provinces was bound to conformity in the course or tariffing
of its money, while left free to determine the species
and mere numismatic detail of the coins.</p>

<p>The various tariffs therefore, already described, contain
the Mint law as applied to the United Provinces;<!-- Page 349 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
but it was not until 1606 that a serious attempt at
systematisation was made. By the great plakkaat of
21st March 1606, completed by that of 6th July 1610,
a new and very full tariff was imposed; an important
regulation was made, declaring all coins which lacked
more than 1 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> engels over and above the remedy, to be
taken as bullion and not current as coin, and the indenture
details of the gold coins were fixed, as it proved, throughout
the life of the Republic.</p>

<p>The gold rijder and the gold ducat were prescribed as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
            GOLD RIJDER.<br/>
<br/>
Weight (gross), 207.2 azen (= 9.95 grs.).<br/>
Weight (of fine gold), 187.77 azen (= 9.11 grs.).<br/>
Standard, 22 carat (= .9167).<br/>
       (Equivalence = 10 fl. 2 st.).<br/>
<br/>
            GOLD DUCAT.<br/>
<br/>
Weight (gross), 72 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> azen (= 3.494 grs.).<br/>
Weight (of fine gold), 71.43 azen (=3.432 grs.).<br/>
Standard = 23 carat 8 grs. (= .9826).<br/>
       (Equivalence = 3 fl. 16 st.).<br/>
</p>

<p>By Article 23 of this same ordinance of 1606, the
further minting of billon money was forbidden, and at the
same time it was enacted, with regard to the lower denominations
of silver coins (schillings and smaller pieces),
that not more than one-tenth of any total settlement should
be tenderable in them, in case of sums exceeding 100
guldens.</p>

<p>The succeeding experience of the effect of these
tariffs, involving, as they did, the almost total disappearance
of the great silver coins, even already by the
year 1638, led in 1659 to the institution of two new silver<!-- Page 350 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
coins&mdash;(1) the silver ducat, .868 fine, and containing
507 azen fine silver; and (2) the silver rijder, .937 fine;
and containing 634.75 azen fine silver.</p>

<p>By the plakkaat of 25th December 1681, the states of
Holland and West Friezland prescribed the minting of the
gulden piece, thus at last making the gulden, so long
simply an ideal money or money of account, a real coin,
and laying the basis of a truer national currency system.</p>

<p>By subsequent proclamations and resolutions of the
States-General of the 17th March 1694, and 31st December
1699, this was adopted for all the United Provinces.</p>

<p>The single gulden piece was to be of the standard of
10 pf. 22 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> grs., and to contain 200 azen fine silver.</p>

<p>This coin remained the mint coin of the Dutch system,
without any further alteration of tariff, or any need of it
till 1806.</p>

<p>With regard to the development of a specific law of
tender, the legislation of the United Provinces was peculiarly
involved. The first declaration of a wide nature was that
of the 26th September 1686, which reduced certain coins,&mdash;the
silver ducat and two others&mdash;to the position of trade
money merely. This was repeated in the declaration of the
States-General of the 7th August 1691. The declaration
of the 1st August 1749 ascribed a similarly restricted
character, of trade money merely, to all gold coins except
the gold rijder and its half. These latter were fixed at an
equivalence of 14 and 7-florin respectively. The gold
ducats were not fixed, their course as trade money might
fluctuate daily. They might be taken freely by weight,
and at values determined by the course of trade.<!-- Page 351 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p>The meaning of this provision can only be read in the
light of the experience of the preceding half century.
Up to this date (1749) there had existed, in theory, a
silver standard with gold rated to it by each succeeding
tariff. The fall of silver throughout the seventeenth
century had acted adversely on gold, and for long the
currency had consisted almost entirely of silver. This fall
received some slight check in the earlier part of the
eighteenth century, and the result was a reverse tendency.
Gold came back into circulation, and the full weighted
silver coins began to flow out and away. A bitter cry
was accordingly raised in 1720 by the commercial community,
and already in 1720 the Mint authorities had
proposed the adoption of the gold rijder as standard, in
order to stop the drain.</p>

<p>In 1749, however, the Mint officials felicitated themselves
on the non-adoption of this proposal, and prayed
that the ducat should be merely declared trade money
(26th March 1749); and it was on this advice that the
plakkaat of 31st March 1749 passed. It proved insufficient
to prevent the export of silver, and on the 1st August
following, the States-General issued an order creating the
gold rijder provisionally the standard. The right of coining
it was reserved to the State, so that there was no
standard in the modern sense.</p>

<p>The influence of this measure proved to be very slight,
and 172 merchants of Amsterdam petitioned the States-General
to declare the tenderableness of the ducat again.
The result of a further communication from the Mint
officials was the proclamation and ordinance of 1st May<!-- Page 352 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
1750, according to which only the gold rijder and half-rijder
were declared standard, and all other gold species
only trade money. Gradually, however, what the Government
had been unable to effect by legislation was accomplished
by the mere force of a rise in gold or fall in silver.
The gold rijders began to disappear, the complaints
as to the disappearance of silver ceased, and the
regulations of 1749 and 1750 were superseded. At the
time of the French Revolution, therefore, the silver standard
was actually in force. Nominally the gold rijder was still
legal tender at 14 florins, but actually few specimens of it
were in circulation.</p>

<p>In 1798 the establishment of the Batavian Republic
necessitated the creation of a Batavian Mint, and on the
12th February 1800 the First Chamber was called upon to
consider the coins.</p>

<p>It was not, however, until the year 1806, after the
Republic had been superseded by the imposition of Louis
Napoleon as King of Holland, that an effectual system was
enunciated. By the resolution of 15th December 1806, a
double standard was adopted.</p>

<p>With the annihilation of the Napoleonic structure this
scheme perished, and the law of 28th September 1816
erected a system in which elements of both those previously

<p>The trade money was only minted for private accompt.
The unit gulden and the 3-gulden piece were also minted
for private accompt, but the divisional silver money, the
copper money, and the gold standard 10-gulden piece
were only to be minted on Government account.</p>

<p>By Article 15 of this law the franc was adopted in the
Southern provinces on a footing of</p>

<blockquote><p>1 franc = 47 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> carats.<br/>
1 gulden <span class="correction" title="= added">=</span>  2 francs 11 <span class="above">61</span>&#8260;<span class="below">100</span> centimes.</p></blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 354 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
Finally, by Article 18, the tender of copper was limited
to 1 gulden, and that of the smaller silver denomination to
one-fifth of the amount of settlement.</p>

<p>By the succeeding law of 22nd March 1839, the silver
Netherland gulden was prescribed to be of the weight of
10 wigtje's or grms., and .945 fine.</p>

<p>This prescription was retained as to the gulden in the
more important Act of 26th November 1847.</p>

<p>This Act definitely established the silver standard.
The standard coins were declared to be the gulden (and
its half) and the rijksdaalder (= 2 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> guldens). The gold
<i>William</i> and the gold <i>dukaat</i> were declared to be trade
money, and the minor or divisional silver coins (25 cents
and under) were fixed at a fineness of .645. The gold
William was to weigh 6.729 grms., .900 fine (content of
pure gold, therefore, to be 6.056 grms.). The gold dukaat
was to weigh 3.494 grms., .983 fine (therefore to contain
3.4345 grms. fine gold).</p>

<p>The coinage of standard silver coins, and of gold trade
coins, was left free to individuals (Article 18). The trade
money was expressly declared to be no legal tender (<i>geen
wettig betaalmiddel</i>, Article 20).</p>

<p>The tender of silver divisional coins was limited to 10
guldens, and that of copper coins to 1 gulden.</p>

<p>This silver standard continued in force until 1872. In
that year, however, in consequence of the fall of silver, a
Bill was passed to suspend the coining of silver for private
accompt. The Mint was closed to its coinage, and for
a time Holland had no metallic standard at all, as gold was
only merchandise or trade money. This state of things led<!-- Page 355 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
to the enactment of the law of 6th June 1875, which introduced
the gold standard, but under peculiar arrangements.</p>

<p>The standard coins were declared to be&mdash;<i>beside</i>, or in
addition to, the silver standard coins minted previously to
the new law&mdash;the gold 10-gulden piece, .900 fine, containing
6.048 grs. fine gold (weight, therefore, 6.720 grms.).</p>

<p>The minting of these latter was declared free to the
individual, and the minting of the gold Williams ordered to
cease (Articles 5 and 6).</p>

<p>No further declaration was made as to tender, so that
the standard is to be regarded as a limping rather than a
gold standard proper.<!-- Page 356 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_V" id="APPENDIX_V"></a>APPENDIX V</h2>

<h4>THE MONETARY SYSTEM OF GERMANY</h4>


<p>The German Mint system inherited from that of Charlemagne
the common features noticed already in the case of
Florence, the Netherlands, and other countries, namely, the
division of the silver libra into 20 solidi (<i>schillingen</i>), and
of the solidus into 12 denarii (<i>pfennige</i>), so that 240
denarii = 1 libra. The solidus occurs (theoretically or in
accompt) in both gold and silver. The gold solidus of the
German system originally weighed less than the Frankish,
which was 72 to the libra, while the German was 80 to
the libra.</p>

<p>The ratio of gold to silver was 12:1, so that theoretically
1 pound silver = 1 oz. gold = 6 <span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> gold schilling.</p>

<p>In actual coins, 1 gold schilling = 3 silver schillingen =
36 pfennige.</p>

<p>Gradually this system was superseded by that of
reckoning by the mark. The particular mark which
obtained widest acceptance was the Cologne mark, which
was thus subdivided&mdash;<!-- Page 361 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>


<table summary="table">
<tr><td>Cologne mark</td><td> = 8 Oz.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>= 16 Loth.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>= 64 Quintlein.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>= 256 Pfennige.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>= 512 Heller.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>= 4352 Eschen or Grain.</td></tr>
</table>


<p>For the purpose of standard of alloy the mark was
differently subdivided. Thus&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gold alloy weight&mdash;</p>

<table summary="table">
<tr><td>1 mark</td><td>= 12 carats</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>= 288 grs. (12 x 24).</td></tr>

<table summary="table">
<tr><td>1 mark</td><td>= 16 loth</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>= 288 grs. (16 x 18).</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>Subsequently, when the gold gulden began to be minted,
and to displace in reckoning the gold solidi (6 <span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> to the oz.),
a third system of reckoning by gulden, schillingen, and
pfennige was adopted. But long before this had become
general, the downward course of the pfennige had proceeded
apace.</p>

<p>In 1255, in Swabia, the silver mark was minted into
660 pfennige; and in 1276, in Magdeburg, the mark of
silver (15 loth fine) into 528 pfennige.</p>

<p>Originally heller and kreutzer were only alternative
forms of the pfennige, not subdivisions of it (heller =
Hällische pfennige); but the irregular course of depreciation
established a difference in character.<a name="FNanchor_24_30" id="FNanchor_24_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_30" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>In 1407, in the Bishopric of Würzburg, pfennige were<!-- Page 362 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
minted at a tale of 400 to the mark and 6 loth fine; Heller
544 to the mark and 4 loth fine. Fifty years later, at
Nürnberg, pfennige were being minted 512 to the mark
and 5 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> loth fine (= 1560 <span class="above">8</span>&#8260;<span class="below">21</span> to the mark of fine silver),
and Heller at 704 to the mark and 3 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> loth fine (= 3218 <span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">7</span>
to the mark fine).</p>

<p>The course of depreciation proceeded from the unregulated,
irresponsible mintings of the small states, and from
base financier craft. During the fourteenth century it proceeded
apace, in spite of the attempts at a reform made by
the Emperor Charles <span class="smcap">IV.</span> In 1356 he prescribed the minting
of the mark of silver into 31 schillingen 4 heller (or
376 hellers), but the ordinance remained ineffectual.</p>

<p>The depreciation against which it vainly strove was not
confined to the lower species, such as pfennige and heller.
The close of the thirteenth century had witnessed the introduction
of a new large silver money, which for a time
stood by the side of the schilling, and then gradually
displaced it. The new coin&mdash;the <i>groschen</i>, minted in
imitation of the gros Tournois of France&mdash;made its first
appearance in Bohemia in 1296, when its tale was 63 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> to
the mark, 15 loth fine. The same process of depreciation
at once began to affect it, and during the fourteenth century
the downward course of the coin was very rapid,
especially in Saxony (see Tables <i>infra</i>, and pp. <a href="#Page_30">30</a>, <a href="#Page_97">97</a>).
With the commencement of a gold coinage in the middle
of the same century, a third element of confusion was
introduced, and quickly the same diversity of weight, alloy,
and type began to prevail as in the silver coinage (see Table
of the depreciation of the gold gulden, <i>infra</i>, and pp. <a href="#Page_31">31</a>, <a href="#Page_98">98</a>).<!-- Page 363 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<p>The Reichstag, which met at Nürnberg in 1438, found
itself driven to record, in simple terms, the right of everybody
who could mint to do so according to what standard
of fineness and weight he pleased, "seeing the impossibility
of a common standard and weight."</p>

<p>The close of the century witnessed the introduction of
the last of these numerous confusing elements, but one
which was to become of prime importance in the history
of German currency, namely, the <i>thaler</i>. In its first form
it was intended as the silver equivalent of the <i>gold gulden</i>,
being minted 8 to the mark (<i>i.e.</i> 1 oz. weight per piece), and
of fine (or 16 loth) silver. It received the name <i>gulden
groschen</i> when first coined by Archduke Sigismund of
Austria in 1484; but in the sixteenth century, on account
of its great manufacture in Bohemia, it became known as
the <i>Joachims thaler</i> (or <i>Schlicken thaler</i>, or <i>Löwen thaler</i>).
The subsequent depreciation of the thaler, which came as a
matter of course, was very unequal in the different circles,
being most strongly marked in Saxony.</p>

<p>By the first of the Imperial Mint Ordinances, which
will be spoken of immediately, the weight of this piece
was still retained at 1 oz., but the standard was reduced
to 15 loth fine. In 1549 the Elector Maurice fixed the
standard at 14 loth 8 grs. fine, while still retaining the
tale of 8 to the mark.</p>

<p>The second Imperial Mint Ordinance of 1551 was
constructed as a double basis&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1. Of the gulden groschen (<i>i.e.</i> thaler) = 1 gold gulden = 72 kr.<br/>
2. Of the gulden groschen (<i>i.e.</i> thaler) = 1 gold gulden = 60 kr.</p></blockquote>

<p>The tale was altered from 8 to 7 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> to the mark, but the<!-- Page 364 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
standard was lowered still further to 14 loth 2 grs. fine
(= 8 <span class="above">120</span>&#8260;<span class="below">254</span> to the mark of fine silver). But in the accompanying
tariff the actual specie thaler-piece was set at
22 groschen, or 66 kreutzers.</p>

<p>The third Imperial Mint Ordinance established an important
difference from this system<span class="correction" title="corrected from ','">.</span> The actual thaler or
silver gulden (= 72 kreutzers) was ordered to be discontinued,
and no more minted, and a different basis adopted
of silver Reichs guldens = 60 kreutzers, at a tale of 9 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> to
the mark, 14 loth 16 grs. fine.</p>

<p>This intended exclusion of the thaler, however, proved
quite ineffectual. Protestations were raised against it,
and in the Reichstag at Augsburg the minting of the
thaler was again authorised&mdash;8 to the mark, 14 loth
4 grs. fine.</p>

<p>The immediately succeeding movement of the thaler is
given in the text (see Table, p. <a href="#Page_103">103</a>).</p>

<p>Further than, as above, it is out of the question in so
brief a résumé to specify the minuter confusions and conflicting
variations of the German monetary system at the
opening of the sixteenth century. During the course of
that century three separate attempts were made to establish
an imperial system that should displace all minor ones, and
thus remedy the confusion.</p>

<p>The first attempt was made by Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> in his
Imperial Mint Ordinance issued at Esslingen on the 10th
November 1524.</p>

<p>The basis of this ordinance was the mark of silver = 8
florins 10 schillings 8 heller, and the pieces ordained
were&mdash;<!-- Page 365 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>1. A silver piece = 1 Rhenish gold gulden, 8 to the mark, 15 loth fine (see
the account of the thaler above).<br/>
2. <i>Orth</i>, 32 to mark, 15 loth fine.<br/>
3. <i>Zähender</i> =  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">10</span> Rhenish gold gulden, 80 to mark, 15 loth fine.<br/>
4. <i>Groschen</i> =  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">21</span> Rhenish gold gulden, 12 loth fine, 136 to mark.</p></blockquote>

<p>Besides these coins, the ordinance recognised temporarily
a whole series of then-current pfennige. Thus&mdash;</p>

<p>As explained in the text (p. <a href="#Page_96">96</a>), this ordinance came
nowhere into observance, and twenty-nine years later
Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> issued his second Imperial Ordinance at the
Reichstag of Augsburg (1551).</p>

<p>The system then attempted to be instituted was based
on a mark of fine silver = 10 florins 12 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> kreutzers but in
denomination a double system was employed&mdash;</p>

<p>Accompanying these regulations, however, there was a
tariff as before, but more comprehensive, for the temporary
recognition of a miscellaneous mass of coins of the Rhine,<!-- Page 366 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>

<p>This ordinance obtained no more vogue than its predecessor,
the main cause of its slighting being the dissatisfaction
of the powers of Upper and Lower Saxony at the
tariffing of the thaler, which they declared to be too low,
and accordingly advanced (1555) to 24 groschen (= 32
Marien groschen = 72 kreutzers).</p>

<p>The third Imperial Ordinance was issued at Augsburg
on the 19th August 1559. Practically the same standard
and basis was maintained as in the preceding ordinance, the
mark of fine silver being coined into 10 florins 13 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> kreutzers
in the larger species.<!-- Page 367 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p>But in the detail of these larger species an important
difference was established.</p>

<p>The silver gulden had hitherto been equal to the gold
gulden. The actual specie silver gulden in pieces of the
time was nominally equivalent to 60 kreutzers. But since
1551 there had been minted a Reichs gulden in specie equal
to 72 kreutzers.</p>

<p>In order to mark the difference it was determined to
coin in future only silver gulden = 60 kreutzers, while the
gold gulden was put at 75 kreutzers.</p>

<p>The specie authorised by this third Imperial Ordinance
therefore were&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1. Gold gulden, 72 to mark, 18 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-carat fine, to equal 75 kreutzers.</p>

<p>2. Silver Reichs gulden, 9 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> to the mark, 14 loth 16 grs. fine, to equal 60
kreutzers.</p>

<p>3. Thaler, or 72 kreutzers silver gulden, to be discontinued.</p>

<p>4. Kreutzer, to equal  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">80</span> gulden, 243 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> to the mark, 6 loth 4 grs. fine
(= 626 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">7</span> to the mark fine).</p>

<p>5. Reichs groschen, to equal  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">24</span> gulden, 8 loth fine, 108 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> to the mark; and
a few other species.</p></blockquote>

<p>The lower denominations (pfennige and heller) were
minted on the basis of the mark = 11 florins 5 kreutzers.</p>

<p>Almost immediately, protestations were raised against
this ordinance, especially by the Lower Westphalian Circle,
and it remained quite inoperative. The succeeding Reichstag
at Augsburg again authorised the issue of the thaler
(8 to the mark, 14 loth 4 grs. fine, so that the fine mark =
10 florins 12 kreutzers).</p>

<p>As late as the Reichstag of Regensburg (1594)
desultory attempts were made to establish a uniform
system, but all practical idea of it had long ceased, and<!-- Page 368 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
the regulation of Mint matters henceforth fell into the
separate jurisdiction of the various Circles. The Lower
Circles went their own way at their meetings at Cologne
(1566, 1572, and 1582), as did the Upper Circles in their
separate meetings in 1564 and 1572 at Nördlingen and
Nürnberg.</p>

<p>At its meeting at Lüneburg in 1568 the Lower Saxon
Circle adopted a system not far removed from that of the
third Imperial Mint Ordinance of 1559. The mark of fine
silver was to be coined into 10 florins 43 <span class="above">11</span>&#8260;<span class="below">67</span> kreutzers, and
the thaler was fixed at 24 groschen (=72 kreutzers).</p>

<p>Underneath this separately concerted action of the
Circles, however, licence and disorder prevailed in the issue
of smaller pieces of a grossly depreciated nature, before
which the good heavy silver species disappeared, leaving
the greatest confusion, together with a continual rise in
prices or fall in the standard. The imperial proclamations
of 20th January and 24th September 1571 were of
no avail against this process, and by 1585 the mercantile
rate had risen, thus&mdash;</p>

<table summary="table">

<tr><td>Reichs thaler</td><td>= 74&nbsp;&nbsp;"</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gulden groschen</td><td>= 64&nbsp;&nbsp;"</td></tr>

<p>In 1596 the Imperial Commissioners at Frankfort
provisionally recognised as a tariff&mdash;</p>

<table summary="table">
<tr><td>Gold gulden</td><td>=80 kr.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Reichs thaler</td><td>=72&nbsp;&nbsp;"</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gulden groschen or thaler</td><td>= 64&nbsp;&nbsp;"</td></tr>
</table>

<p>But later in the same year these authorities at Strasburg
set the Reichs thaler at 84 kreutzers (mark of fine silver =<!-- Page 369 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
12 fl. 36 kr.). As the disorder of the <i>Kipper und Wipper
Zeit</i> broke over the Empire, in consequence of the process
of wilful depreciation, the Emperor made several public
attempts at its arrestation by letters addressed to the
various Circles separately (1601, 1603, and 1607). Meanwhile,
the Reichs thaler had risen to 90 kreutzers (mark of
fine silver = 13 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> florins).</p>

<p>According to this valuation the gulden of 1551 of 72
kreutzers was set at 94 kreutzers, and the gulden of 1559 of
60 kreutzers was set at 79 kreutzers.</p>

<p>It was on this latter basis (of the 60-kreutzer Reichs
gulden of 1559 = 79 kreutzers) that was founded the later
Misnian, Franconian, and Kammer-Gerichts currencies of
the eighteenth century, which did not materially differ
amongst themselves, thus&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Misnian gulden    @ 31 groschen (= 78 <span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> kr.)<br/>
Franconian gulden @ 20 batzen   (= 80 kr.)<br/>
Kammer-Gerichts gulden           = 78 kr. 2 <span class="above">10</span>&#8260;<span class="below">23</span> thalers.
</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1623 the Higher Circles adopted by their Mint
determination the following system:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thaler      = 90 kr.<br/>
Gold gulden = 1 fl. 44 kr.<br/>
Ducat       = 2 fl. 20 kr.
</p></blockquote>

<p>In the smaller pieces the basis was the mark of fine
silver = 16-florin = 10 <span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> thaler.</p>

<p>For example&mdash;</p>

<p><!-- Page 370 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
To this system the Lower Circles acceded, in the same
year 1623, after an ineffectual attempt to enforce the
interim standard of 1596, which had set the Reichs thaler
at 21 batzen or 84 kreutzers.</p>

<p>From this united action of the Upper and Lower Circles
Saxony stood apart, following quite a different course.
While elsewhere the thaler was raised, here they lowered it
to its old equivalence of 24 groschen. In actual practice,
however, the step proved only half effective, as the depreciated
thaler was persistently minted. There resulted
accordingly, in Saxony, a double system of "good" and
"bad" money, with a difference of something like 25 per
cent. between them. To increase the confusion there was
for a time a difference between the practice of Lower
Saxony and Electoral Saxony. The former, Lower
Saxony, had in 1610 adopted the following system:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="table" class="mono">

<tr><td colspan="2" align="center">(So that the mark of fine silver = 12 fl. 9 kr.)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Finding it impossible to maintain this system, they
altered it in 1617, and finally in 1622 conformed with
Higher Saxony, setting the Reichs thaler at 24 silver
groschens.</p>

<p>As settled in this and the following year, the system of
Electoral and Lower Saxony was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="table">
<tr><td>Reichs thaler</td><td>= 24</td><td>gulden groschen.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Through the remaining period of the Thirty Years' War
very little is on record with regard to the German Mint
system. The closing period of the strife was marked
by such complaints as to excess of depreciated small
specie as had prevailed in 1620, bringing with it a further
enhancement of the price of the larger silver specie. In
1665, accordingly, the three Higher Circles, Franconia,
Bavaria, and Swabia met together. They found on a
trial that the mark of fine silver was selling commercially
at from 14 florins 15 kreutzers to 14 florins 20 kreutzers,
and that it was impossible to mint the larger silver specie
unless the Reichs thaler were set at 96 kreutzers. This
would raise the mark of fine silver to 14 florins 24 kreutzers.
At the same time it was resolved to declare the ducat at
3 florins (mark of fine gold = 203 florins 49 kreutzers, 3 <span class="above">31</span>&#8260;<span class="below">71</span>
pfennige), the ratio being accordingly changed from 15
to 14<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>.</p>

<p>In 1667 this scheme was provisionally adopted <i>in
comitiis</i>. From this scheme Saxony and Brandenburg
held off, maintaining that the advance of the Reichs thaler
was not sufficient. They accordingly, in the same year,
adopted the so-called <i>Zinnaische</i> standard, setting the
Reichs thaler at 1 florin 45 kreutzers (105 kreutzers), equal
to 18 good groschens (mark of fine silver = 10 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> thalers, or
15 florins 45 kreutzers).<!-- Page 372 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>The enactment of this system gave rise to a new

<p>The three Upper Circles, however, could not maintain
their last enacted order. In spite of its enactment, the
Reichs thaler rose again to 96 kreutzers, and the ducat to
3 florins 12 kreutzers.<!-- Page 373 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

<p>The confusion and general harm which resulted has
been referred to in the text (p. <a href="#Page_199">199</a>), and it is to be
regarded simply as a stop-gap at any cost that the
measure proposed by the Three Circles of fixing the
thaler at 90 kreutzers was carried through the Reichstag
of 1680.</p>

<p>From this system, however, the Emperor, with Bavaria
and Salzburg, stood apart, putting the Reichs thaler at 96
kreutzers; and ten years later, 1690, Saxony, Brandenburg,
and Brunswick and Lüneburg established again a distinct
system&mdash;the well-known Leipzig standard.</p>

<p>By this system the Reichs thaler was set at 120
kreutzers or 2 florins (mark of fine silver = 12 thalers 18
gulden).</p>

<p>In a few years this valuation of the thaler prevailed
all over the Empire. Sweden acceded to it in 1690, with
Bremen and Pomerania, Mainz, Treves, the Palatinate, and
Frankfort, and three years later the Higher Circles followed
suite. Contemporaneously the gold gulden was advanced
to 2 florins 56 kreutzers.</p>

<p>Although the Emperor subsequently joined in the recognition
of the Leipzig standard, it did not remain effective
in actual practice, and while no further advance of the
thaler was officially recognised, the lower denominations
were again depreciated by the Mint competition of the
various states, 10-kreutzer pieces being minted on a
standard of 20 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> to 21 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> gulden to the mark fine. In
1736 the question of a standard was again brought before
the Reichstag; and on the 10th September 1738 it was
resolved to adopt the Leipzig standard for the Empire,<!-- Page 374 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
with the Reichs thaler = 2 florins, ducat = 4 florins, gold
gulden = 3 florins; while, for the divisional coins, a basis of
fine mark silver = 13 <span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> thaler was enacted.</p>

<p>This system, if it endured at all, did so only for a
couple of years. The outbreak of the war of the Austrian
Succession brought with it a new period of conflicting
depreciations, and at the close Austria took a decisive step.
Without taking any measure to secure the co-operation
of the Circles, or any part of the Empire, the Emperor
Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> adopted the 20-gulden standard (the mark of
fine silver = 13 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> Reichs thalers = 20 guldens). It was at
once adopted in Hungary and Bohemia, the territories of
Maria Theresa.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus, Elector of Saxony and King of
Poland, was the first to adopt this Austrian standard, at
Dresden in 1750, though with a very slight variation
(putting the mark of fine silver at 13 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> Reichs thalers
instead of 13 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span>). In 1753 Bavaria also acceded to
the 20-gulden standard, after a brief attempt (1747-1753)
at the erection of a 24-gulden standard, and in
the following year the Austrian system was adopted
by Brandenburg-Anspach, Bayreuth, Würzburg, and
Nürnberg.</p>

<p>The Convention of Vienna (21st September 1753)
which formally established this Austrian or Convention
standard (20-gulden system), prescribed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Gold&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Mark of fine gold = 283 fl. 5 kr. 4 <span class="above">47</span>&#8260;<span class="below">74</span> pf. Chief coin = Reichs ducat, 67 to
the mark (Cologne mark), 23 kr. 8 grs. fine (= 67 <span class="above">67</span>&#8260;<span class="below">71</span> to the mark of fine gold),
to = 4 fl. 10 kr.; the Holland and other ducats then current in Germany being
tariffed at 4 fl. 7 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> kr.</p></blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 375 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span> 2. Silver&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Mark of fine silver = 20 guldens for all manner of silver coins down to the
groschen or 3-kreutzer piece (ratio of silver to gold 1:14 <span class="above">11</span>&#8260;<span class="below">21</span>).</p></blockquote>

<p>The silver coins authorised were&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1. Thaler (specie or convention thaler = 2 fl.), 10 to the mark, 13 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> loth

<p>For the lowest denomination of divisional coins, half-groschen,
kreutzer, and pfennige, quite varying standards
were permitted, according to the piece or locality, namely,
from 20 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> to 33 guldens to the Koln mark.</p>

<p>Such was the Convention System or Standard, which, by
the accession of the Electoral Palatinate, and of Salzburg
might be practically regarded as the Imperial system.</p>

<p>This Convention system, and these Convention or specie
thaler and other coins, remained the Mint system of Austria
until modern times.<!-- Page 376 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<p>The changes which were made in the Austrian system
by the Vienna Convention of 1857 have been already
detailed (see text, pp. <a href="#Page_209">209</a>-<a href="#Page_212">12</a>).</p>

<p>Ten years later Austria withdrew from this monetary
treaty (in accordance with the terms of the treaty of Berlin,
13th June 1867), with the intention of acceding to the
contemplated French currency treaty of 31st July 1867.
She ceased the coining of German gold crowns and half-crowns,
and instead minted 4 and 1-ducat pieces. From
1870 onwards she coined, in conjunction with Hungary,
8 and 4-florin gold pieces, the former 77 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> to the pound,
.900 fine.</p>

<p>By a decree of 6th November 1870, the 8-florin gold
piece was tariffed at 8.10 florin. At this it was made
legal tender, on the basis of the French ratio of 15 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>; but
it was practically nothing more than commercial money,
like the preceding <i>crowns</i> and <i>half-crowns</i> of the convention
of 1857. The standard of Austria remained nominally the
silver florin of the convention of 1857, although in actual
practice the currency was paper. In March 1879 the
Austrian and Hungarian Mints were closed to the coinage
of silver on private account, preparatory to a reorganisation
of the Austrian monetary system on a gold basis. This
reform was decided on in 1892, and briefly prescribed as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The monetary unit is the krone or crown = 2 florins;
but to be minted in 10 and 20-crown pieces, 1 kilogramme
pure gold = 3280 crowns, .900 fine. The crown is divided
into 100 hellers.</p>

<p>For the purpose of basing the new system on gold, a<!-- Page 377 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
ratio between the old silver and the new gold standard of
1:18.22 was adopted, the existing florin being declared
= 2 francs 10 cents.</p>

<p>Silver is fractional money only, the old florins passing
as 2 crowns.</p>


<h5>South Germany.</h5>

<p>From the Convention or 20-gulden system (the old
Austrian system) sprang the accompanying system, the
24-gulden standard, which was nothing but the 20-gulden
or Austrian standard under another name. Very soon
after the establishment of the Convention standard, the
Elector of Bavaria perceived or concluded that the continuance
of that standard in his dominions would produce
disorders so long as the other circles did not accede to the
convention. He accordingly arrested the execution of the
convention in his territories, and adopted a provisional
arrangement. At the end, however, of a long correspondence
with the Austrian state (Maria Theresa), an agreement
was made that he should conform his coins in
standard and weight to the convention system, but should
be permitted to tariff them at one-fifth higher rate, putting
<i>i.e.</i> the specie thaler not at 2 florins but at 2 florins 24 kr.,
and so on (the mark of silver being consequently worth
24 guldens, instead of, as in the Austrian or Convention
system, 20 guldens).</p>

<p>This was the origin of the 24-gulden standard, which
gradually spread over the whole of South Germany, with
the exception of Austria. The three Upper Circles acceded
in 1761, Salzburg in 1765, and in the following year the<!-- Page 378 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
Rhenish powers, Mainz, Treves, the Palatinate, Hesse-Darmstadt,
and Frankfort.</p>

<p>From this 24-gulden standard sprang towards the close
of the eighteenth century a later development, due to the circulation
of the kronen thaler or Brabant thaler, which, from
1755 onwards, Austria minted for her Netherland possessions.
The Rhenish provinces drove this piece above its
Mint rate, setting it at 2 florins 42 kreutzers, although in
the 24-gulden standard its value was only 2 florins 38 <span class="above">10</span>&#8260;<span class="below">19</span>
kreutzers. This implied a standard of 24<span class="above">6</span>&#8260;<span class="below">11</span> guldens to the
mark of fine silver, and gradually, about the beginning of
the present century, Bavaria, Würtemberg, and Nassau minted
convention thalers on the same footing. Baden, Hesse, and
Saxe-Coburg followed suit in their minting of kronen
thalers until, by the Mint Convention of the South German
states in 1837, the new standard (the 24 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-gulden standard)
was formally recognised as the South German standard.
In this convention Austria had no part.</p>

<p>The standard here detailed, the 24 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-gulden or South
German standard, was assimilated to the Prussian system
in the Dresden Convention, 1838 (see text, p. <a href="#Page_205">205</a>), and in
that connection remained intact until the developments of
modern times detailed in the text, p. <a href="#Page_215">215</a>.</p>


<h5>Prussia.</h5>

<p>The Prussian monetary system, as a separate identity,
took its rise in that same period which witnessed the
independent action of Austria, above detailed. Its builder
was Frederick the Great, who, for this purpose, called in the
advice of a Dutch merchant, Philip Graumann. It is to<!-- Page 379 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
this latter that is due the introduction in 1750 of the
21-gulden or 14-thaler standard, otherwise known as the
Graumann standard.</p>

<blockquote><p>Thaler = 10 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> to the mark, 12 loth fine (mark of fine silver therefore
= 14 thalers or 21 guldens).</p>

<p>Thaler = 24 groschens = 288 pfennige (24 × 12).</p>

<p>Groschen and  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-groschen minted as divisional coins (=  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">24</span> and  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">48</span>
thaler) of billon.</p></blockquote>

<p>After the temporary debasement during the Seven Years'
War, the Graumann standard was re-established in 1764,
but with two differences.</p>

<p>1. The minting of  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> and  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-thaler pieces of 12 loth

<p>2. The billon divisional money (minted primarily for
the Provincial States of Prussia) was greatly increased in
the amount of its issue, but depreciated in standard on a
varying scale according to the districts intended, Silesia,
Cleves, etc., reaching in some cases even to an 18-thaler
standard. Up to 1772 there was issued in these depreciated
single and double-groschen pieces an amount equal to
8,979,189 thalers. Subsequently, the standard of divisional
money was reduced to 21 thalers, and at this rate, up to
the death of Frederick in 1786, there were issued in
6-pfennige and other pieces 12,586,863 thalers' worth.
From this time onward, up to the decrying of this depreciated
divisional money at the peace of Tilsit, there was
minted a matter of 29,628,807 thaler worth.<!-- Page 380 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>

<p>The total, therefore, was 42,215,670 thalers; the
pure silver content of which was only 28,243,780
thalers.</p>

<p>By the publicandum of 4th May 1808, and the edict
of 13th December 1811, the value of this mass was reduced,
the coins being set at from two-thirds to four-sevenths of
their normal value, so that&mdash;</p>

<p>but it was not till the law of 30th September 1821
that a recoinage could be accomplished.</p>

<p>The provisions of this law of 1821 were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Gold&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Friedrichs d'or as hitherto, viz. 35 to the mark = 5 thalers.</p></blockquote>

<p>4. Silver&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Prussian thaler as before, 10 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> to the mark gross (= 14 to the
mark fine).</p>

<p>7. Thaler to be subdivided into 30 groschens 12 pfennige;
the latter tenderable only up to  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">6</span> thaler.</p>

<p>8. Silver groschen = 106 <span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> to the mark,  <span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">9</span> silver (= 16 thalers
to the mark fine).</p></blockquote>

<p>By the law of 1821, this standard came into operation
in 1626, and it remained the standard for Prussia and her
provinces until the developments in modern times, specified
in the text, p. <a href="#Page_215">215</a>.</p>

<p>At the convention of Dresden, 30th July 1838, the
Prussian 14-thaler or 21-gulden standard was adopted,
along with the South German or 24 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-gulden standard as
the standard of the German Zollverein.</p>

<p>Subsequent to that date the Prussian system was<!-- Page 381 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
adopted by Hanover, Brunswick, Oldenburg, Mecklenburg,
Waldeck, Lippe, etc.</p>

<p>But long before 1840 almost the whole of this amount
had disappeared or been melted down.<!-- Page 382 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>

<p>In state payments the Friedrich d'or was taken at 5
thalers, but in ordinary commerce up to 1783 they were
taken at 5 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> thalers, a tariff which gradually rose to 5 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> and
5 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> thalers. The purchases of gold which the Bank of
England made in 1816, in order to its resumption of cash
payments, drove the pistole or Friedrich d'or up to 5 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>
thalers, and it was not for ten years that it fell back to 5 <span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span>
thalers.</p>

<p>Although paid by Government at this latter, and so
continued till the Mint Convention of 1853, it was only as
a mercantile commodity. The only legal standard and
tender in Prussia was silver (the silver thaler), to which gold
was varyingly ratable, according to market fluctuations.</p>

<p>The Prussian system thus described remained in force
until the Vienna coinage treaty of 24th January 1857, the
details of which have been already stated in the text.
The resolutions of that treaty were adopted by the Prussian
Mint law of 4th May 1857, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The Prussian pound of 500 grms., decimally
divided, is substituted for the previous standard of 233.865
grms.</p>

<p>2-6. The thaler continues the regular silver coin of the
country&mdash;</p>

<p>Thirty thalers to the pound of pure silver, .900 fine.</p>

<p>Thus the 30-thaler standard to take the place of the
old 14-thaler standard, but the two to be treated as the
same.</p>

<p>The thaler to be coinable as a convention thaler or
Vereins thaler; thaler to be subdivided into 30 groschens,
at 12 pfennige.<!-- Page 383 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>

<p>7-8. Divisional coin limited in tender to  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">6</span> thaler as
before, and both minted on a 34 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-thaler standard.</p>

<p>11. Gold commercial coins shall be coined under the
names of "crown" and "half-crown," in the form and with
the attribution of confederation coins, viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>
1. Crown,  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">50</span> of a pound of fine gold (.900 fine).<br />
2. Half-crown,  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">100</span>     "               "<br />
</p>

<p>These coins shall be the special gold coins of the
country, and other gold pieces shall not henceforth be coined.</p>

<p>14. The silver value of the gold coinage shall be
entirely fixed by the relation of the supply to the demand,
and no one is bound to take gold in the place of the legal
silver value of the country.</p>

<p>16. Our Finance Minister is empowered to settle the
price at which the crown and the half-crown shall be taken
into our pay offices.</p>

<p>The established rate, as well as the permission to
receive crowns and half-crowns instead of silver coins in our
offices, may at any time be revoked or restricted by the
publication of a proclamation by our Finance Minister.</p>

<p>19. Our Minister of State is also authorised to fix the
value above which foreign gold and silver coins must not
be offered or given in payment in ordinary transactions.</p>

<p>The subsequent course of events and the existing
Prussian (Imperial German) system have been already
specified (see text, p. <a href="#Page_215">215</a>).</p>


<h5>Hamburg.</h5>

<p>The origin of the common Mint standard of Lübeck
and Hamburg was the division of the mark into 16<!-- Page 384 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
schillingen, and each schilling into 12 pfennige. The
metal mark and the Mint mark soon parted company, and
by the time of the treaty of 1255 the two states agreed
to mint the mark of fine silver into 38 schillingen
10 pfennige (= 2 marks 6 schillingen 10 pfennige).</p>

<p>The Wendish standard was established by the adoption
in 1325 of the Hamburg-Lübeck treaty by Wismar and
Lüneburg.</p>

<p>In 1433 this Wendish standard adopted the Cologne
mark as its weight basis.</p>

<p>The Mint Union of the Wendish states continued
until the beginning of the seventeenth century, when
it expired unperceived. The experience of Hamburg in
the <i>Kipper und Wipper Zeit</i>, with its resultant establishment
of the Hamburg Bank, has been already referred to.</p>

<p>In 1667 Hamburg freely joined the <i>Zinnaische</i> standard,
according to which the mark of fine silver was coined into<!-- Page 385 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
10 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> thalers (= 31 marks 8 schillingen, <i>Hamburger courant</i>).
She, however, hesitated to follow the German system in its
change over to the Leipzig standard in 1690, and after an
interim period of weltering disorder, during which the
standard varied from 30 marks to 34 marks 8 schillingen
per mark fine of silver, the State adopted in 1725 the
so-called Lübeck standard (1 mark fine = 34 marks), as the
Hamburger courant.</p>

<p>This standard had existed in Holstein from 1693. In
1788 and 1789 long and serious debates were held in
Hamburg on the question of the substitution of a lighter
(or lower) standard. And seventy years later a change in
such direction had practically effected itself, although not
legislatively recognised. By 1850 the actual currency of
the state consisted mostly of silver coins of the Prussian
(or 14-thaler) standard, circulating at an equivalence of
1 thaler = 2 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> marks Hamburger courant (= 40 schillingen),
an equivalence implying a standard of 35 marks courant
to the mark of fine silver.</p>

<p>Legally, however, the 34-marks standard remained in
force until the coalescence of the free state of Hamburg
with the new imperial German system in our own days.</p>

<p>The question of the agio of the <i>Hamburg banco</i>
system belongs rather to the history of banking.</p>


<h5>German Standards: Silver.</h5>

<p>In brief résumé, the historic standards of the German
monetary system have been as follows:&mdash;Nos. 4, 5, 7, 9,
11, 12, 13 representing the systems in existence at the time
of the projection of the great currency reform of 1871:&mdash;<!-- Page 386 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Old imperial standard of 1559, based on the
Reichs Münz ordnung of Ferdinand <span class="smcap">I.</span>, mark of fine silver
= 8 thalers. Altered in 1622, so that 9 thalers 2 grs. =
1 mark fine silver.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Zinnaische</i> standard, agreed upon by Saxony
and Brandenburg at Zinna, 1667, 1 mark fine silver =
10 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> thaler = 15 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> guldens.</p>

<p>3. Leipzig standard or Torgau standard (see text,
p. <a href="#Page_200">200</a>), mark fine silver = 18 gulden.</p>

<p>4. The Prussian standard, 14 thalers or 21 guldens =
1 mark fine silver (see above, p. <a href="#Page_379">379</a>).</p>

<p>5. Convention standard or Austrian standard, mark
fine silver = 20 gulden (see above, p. <a href="#Page_375">375</a>).</p>

<p>6. The 24-gulden standard or new imperial standard
of 1766 (see above, p. <a href="#Page_377">377</a>), 1 mark fine silver =
24 guldens.</p>

<p>7. The 24 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>, or South German standard (see above,
p. <a href="#Page_378">378</a>), 1 mark fine silver = 24 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> guldens.</p>

<p>8. The kronen-thaler standard, existing more or less
between 1808 and 1837 in such of the states of the South
as had adopted the minting of the Brabant or crown
thaler-piece, 9.18 to a mark fine, and issued at 2 guldens
42 kreutzers, representing a 24 <span class="above">4</span>&#8260;<span class="below">5</span>-gulden standard. It was
this system which called into being the 24 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-gulden
standard, by the evolution of which it was itself completely
superseded.</p>

<p>9. Wechselzahlung, or Wechselgeld, the bank reckoning
system of Frankfort-on-the-Maine, 20 <span class="above">4</span>&#8260;<span class="below">55</span> guldens = 13 <span class="above">21</span>&#8260;<span class="below">55</span>
thalers = 1 mark fine silver. The standard was, therefore,
 <span class="above">4</span>&#8260;<span class="below">11</span> lighter than the 20-gulden or convention standard.<!-- Page 387 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p>10. The Augsburg girogeld, a system which existed till
1st July 1845, and in which the exchange with Amsterdam
and Hamburg was expressed. Mark of fine silver =
15 <span class="above">95</span>&#8260;<span class="below">127</span> gulden giro (100 gulden giro = 127 gulden of the
convention standard). This system was displaced by the
introduction of the 24 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-gulden standard.</p>

<p>11. The Lübeck courant (or Hamburg courant, as
described above), the mark of fine silver = 11 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> thaler, or
34 marks.</p>

<p>12. Hamburg banco, the system of reckoning of the
Hamburg Bank. From 1790 the bank reckoned the mark
of fine silver = 9 <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">24</span> thaler-banco, or 27 <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> mark-banco.
The issue rate was, however, 9 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> thaler, or 27 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> mark-banco,
the slight premium simply covering the expenses of the
bank. In 1846 this difference was abolished, the mark of
fine silver both for receipt and disbursement being reckoned
at 27 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> marks (27 marks 12 schillings). The Hamburg
banco was, therefore, appreciated above the Hamburg
courant by a matter of 22.5225 per cent.</p>

<p>13. The Schleswig-Holstein courant, mark of fine
silver = 11 <span class="above">9</span>&#8260;<span class="below">16</span> thaler, or 34 <span class="above">11</span>&#8260;<span class="below">16</span> marks.</p>


<h5>Gold Standards.</h5>

<p>1. Imperial or ducat standard. The Imperial Mint
Ordinance of 1559 contains the first mention of the ducat
in German legislation, prescribing it 67 to the mark, 23 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-carat
fine. Subsequently the standard varied slightly.
Austria minted them 23 carat 8 grs. for herself (<i>kaiserlichen</i>),
at 23 carat 9 grs. for Hungary (<i>kremnitzer</i>). The
other German states approximated between a 23-carat<!-- Page 388 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
6 grs. and a 23-carat 8 grs. standard. Baden struck
ducats 22 carat 6 grs. fine, 63.697 to the mark.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Pistole</i> standard (<i>Friedrichs d'or</i>, <i>August d'or</i>,
<i>Wilhelms d'or</i>, <i>Carls d'or</i>, or generally, <i>Louis d'or</i>), mostly in
the Northern States of Denmark, mostly 35 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">6</span> to the mark,
21 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> carats fine, though with considerable variations (<i>e.g.</i> the
Saxon <i>august d'or</i>, 35 to the mark, 21 carats 8 grs. fine. In
Bremen this was the legal currency, the <i>louis d'or</i> being
taken at 5 thalers at 72 groot, each groot at 5 schwaren).
For a considerable period, far into the present century, the
merchants of Mecklenburg, Hanover, and Brunswick kept
their accounts in gold pistoles (= 5 thalers). Prussia (as
above, p. <a href="#Page_382">382</a>) fixed the pistole at 5 <span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> thalers, but elsewhere
it had a varying (mercantile) equivalence.</p>

<p>3. The gold gulden standard. The last of the three
Imperial Mint Ordinances (1559) prescribed gold gulden 72
to the mark, 18 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> carat fine. They continued to be coined
in Southern German states and in Hanover up to the
middle of the eighteenth century.<!-- Page 389 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span></p>

<p>THE MONETARY SYSTEM OF FRANCE</p>


<p>The metric system on which the French Mint was worked
throughout the period treated of in this work up to the
Revolution was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="table">
<tr><td>1 mark </td><td>=    8 oz.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">  "    </td><td>=   64 gros. (8 × 8).</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">  "   </td><td> =  192 dens. (64 × 3).</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">  "   </td><td> = 4608 grs. (192 × 24).</td></tr>
</table>

<p>An alternative subdivision of the ounce was as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="table">
<tr><td>1 oz.</td><td> =  20 esterlings.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">  "   </td><td>= 320 mailles (20 × 16).</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">  "   </td><td>= 640 felins (320 × 2).</td></tr>
</table>

<p>For the alloy or standard the mark was thus subdivided:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>For gold mark = 24 carats each subdivided into 32 parts.<br/>
For silver mark = 12 dens. each subdivided into 24 grms.</p></blockquote>

<p>In France fine gold was only refined to 23 <span class="above">26</span>&#8260;<span class="below">32</span> carats, and
fine silver 11 deniers 18 grs. In calculation the absolute
fineness of 24 carats and 12 deniers must be used.<!-- Page 397 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

<p>The system of reckoning was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="table">
<tr><td>1 livre </td><td>= 20 sols.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1 sol. </td><td> = 12 den.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1 den. </td><td> =  2 oboles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1 obole</td><td> =  2 pites.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1 pite </td><td> =  2 semipites.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The reckoning by livres, sols., deniers was derived from
the Frankish kings. For a time the system of reckoning
by the mark threatened to replace it, but in 1313 it was
again authorised by Philippe le Bel.</p>

<p>The origin of the difference between the livres Tournois
and the livres Parisis is to be sought in the feudal
Mint franchises of the barons. At one time there was a
difference between the two systems of 25 per cent., the
barons who had the right of minting preferring to do so
at Tours, or according to the Tours weight, which was the
more depreciated of the two, while at Paris the French kings
attempted to keep up a tradition of a better weight standard.<a name="FNanchor_25_33" id="FNanchor_25_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_33" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The distinction of livres Tournois and livres Parisis
was maintained until the days of Louis <span class="smcap">XIV.</span>, when (1667)
it was abolished, and the reckoning by a single livre, sol.,
denier, was established. (For the intermediate experiment
of Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> see text p. <a href="#Page_87">87</a>.)<a name="FNanchor_26_34" id="FNanchor_26_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_34" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The monetary system of Charlemagne was the precursor
and source of the chief currency systems of mediæval
and modern Europe, with the exception of Spain. It was
itself an imitation of the system of the Eastern Empire.<!-- Page 398 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

<p>Its basis was the <i>libra</i> or pound, which occurs in two
forms&mdash;(1) the gold pound, (2) the silver pound. Under
the first race of the French kings the monetary divisions of
the former were&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The gold solidus, a name which gave birth to the
Spanish and Italian soldo and the French sol. (<i>sou</i>).</p>

<p>2. The third of the gold solidus (Triens or Tremissis).</p>

<p>Of the latter the aliquot parts were&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1. The silver solidus.<br/>
2.  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> silver solidus (Tremissis).<br/>
3. The denarius.<br/>
<br/>
1 gold solidus = 3 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> silver solidi = 40 denarii.<br/>
                 1 silver solidus = 12 denarii<br/>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Under the system of the Eastern Empire the gold
solidus had weighed 85 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> grs. and under the Merovingian
Kings 70 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> grs. Under the rule of the Second House a
considerable alteration took place. Charlemagne adopted
for the basis of his system the East Frank or Rhenish libra,
which was one-fourth heavier than the Roman libra adopted
by the Merovings. His denarius accordingly weighed 32
grs. If ideally constructed the system, as far as silver
is concerned, would be this&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>                 12 denarii = 1 solidus.<br/>
                 20 solidi  = 1 libra.<br/>
32 × 20 × 12 = 7680 grs.    = 1 libra.<br/>
</p></blockquote>

<p>As far as the more precious metal is concerned, the
gold solidus was, as a matter of fact, hardly to be met with
under the second race. But, theoretically, it was still
considered equal to 40 denarii.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>40 × 32 = 1280 grs.<br/>
 <span class="above">1280</span>&#8260;<span class="below">12</span> = 106.6 grs. for the gold solidus.
</p></blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 399 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
But there are some actually met with containing 132 grs.</p>

<p><i>Sols d'or</i> as a reminiscence of the first and second race
are said to have still lingered in use at the commencement
of the third race of kings. Under Philip <span class="smcap">I.</span> they occur as
<i>francs d'or</i> and <i>florins d'or</i>. In speaking of this latter
term in the account of Florentine money (<a href="#Page_301">Appendix <span class="smcap">I.</span></a>
<i>supra</i>, p. <a href="#Page_301">301</a>), it has been pointed out as possible that it
is merely the name for an ideal money, not an actual coin.
(See however, preface, p. <a href="#Page_xiii">xiii.</a>)</p>

<p>The actual reinstitution of gold monies in France has
been already dealt with (text, p. <a href="#Page_10">10</a>). Of the species of the
gold monies it would be almost an impossibility to speak.</p>

<p>Putting aside the disputed florin d'or, the first authenticated
type of the gold monies was the <i>aignel d'or</i> or <i>denier
d'or a l'aignel</i>, so called from the lamb (agneau = aignel),
stamped on it. Under St. Louis, to whom it is first
assigned, it weighed 3 deniers 5 grs., was of fine gold and
worth 12 sols. 6 deniers Tournois.</p>

<p>Philippe le Bel, Louis Huttin, Philippe le Long, and
Charles le Bel maintained this coin at the same weight and
standard. Those of King John were of the same standard
or fineness, but were slightly heavier, weighing 3 deniers 16
grs. Under Charles <span class="smcap">VI.</span> and Charles <span class="smcap">VII.</span> both weight and
fineness were considerably reduced. Under the various
names of <i>agnels d'or</i>, <i>moutons d'or à la grande laine</i>, <i>moutons
d'or à la petite laine</i>, this species had currency in France for
nearly two hundred years. The imitations of it in surrounding
countries were almost numberless.</p>

<p><i>Royal</i> (for the origin of the piece, see text, p. <a href="#Page_10">10</a>).
Philippe le Bel minted <i>petits royaux d'or fin</i>, 70 to the<!-- Page 400 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
mark and with an equivalence of 11 sols. Parisis. Gros
royaux were the double of the petits royaux. Charles le
Bel and Philippe de Valois struck royaux 58 to the mark.
King John struck royaux or <i>deniers d'or au Roial</i> 66 and
69 to the mark, Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> 63 to the mark, and Charles <span class="smcap">VI.</span>
64 and 70 to the mark.</p>

<p><i>Masses</i> or <i>chaises</i> (<i>cadieres</i>, <i>Royaux durs</i>), were coined
by Philippe le Bel, 22-carat fine and 5 deniers 12 grs. the
piece. The <i>chaises d'or</i> of his successor varied greatly from
these. Philippe de Valois coined them of fine gold, and
3 deniers 16 grs. the piece, and Charles <span class="smcap">VI.</span> of fine gold
4 deniers 18 grs. the piece. Under Charles <span class="smcap">VII.</span> the
standard was reduced to 16 carats and the weight to 2
deniers 29 grs.</p>

<p>Of other early gold species it is sufficient to mention&mdash;</p>

<p>The last of these species (<i>deniers d'or à l'écu</i>) continued
to be minted, and had wide currency through the reign of
John up to their cessation in 1354. There was, however,
great variation in the standard from fine gold to 23, 22 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>,
21, and even 18 carats.</p>

<p>The reign of John was marked, 1361, by the commencement
of the coining of the important <i>franc d'or</i> of
fine gold, 63 to the mark = 20 sols. or 1 livre.<!-- Page 401 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span></p>

<p>Its standard (of fine gold) was maintained under Charles
<span class="smcap">V.</span> and until Charles <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, but under the latter monarch the
weight was reduced (to a tale of 80 to the mark).</p>

<p><i>Fleurs de lis d'or</i> (or <i>Florins d'or aux fleurs de lis</i>)
were first minted in 1365 by Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> They were of
fine gold, and weighed exactly 1 gros. Being equivalent
to the franc (<i>i.e.</i> equal to 1 livre or 20 sols.), it received
the same name, being styled <i>Franc à pied</i> to distinguish it
from the <i>Franc d'or</i> proper, which was styled <i>Franc à cheval</i>.</p>

<p><i>Saluts</i> were first minted by Charles <span class="smcap">VI.</span> in 1421 of fine
gold, and of the same weight as the <i>francs à cheval</i>, but
equal to 25 sols.</p>

<p><i>Couronnes</i> or <i>écus à la couronne</i> were first coined by
Charles <span class="smcap">VI.</span> in 1384 of fine gold, weighing 3 deniers 4 grs.
(<i>i.e.</i> 64 to the mark), and equal 22 sols.</p>

<p>This was the most celebrated gold coin of mediæval
France. It lasted down to the time of the louis d'or, and
was in high repute all over Europe.</p>

<p>Under Charles <span class="smcap">VI.</span> and Charles <span class="smcap">VII.</span> numerous changes
were made in this piece both in weight and standard. At
one time, under Charles <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, the standard fell as low as
16 carats. In 1436, however, they were again made of
fine gold, but 70 to the mark, and issued at an equivalence
of 25 sols. In 1455 they were issued 23 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> carats fine,
71 to the mark, and = 27 sols. the piece.</p>

<p>In 1473 Louis <span class="smcap">XI.</span> issued them 72 to the mark; but
two years later he began the issue of <i>écus d'or au soleil</i>
(<i>crowns of the sun</i>), of the same fineness as the couronne, but
slightly heavier (70 to the mark).</p>

<p>From the days of Charles <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> the <i>crown of the sun</i><!-- Page 402 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
(<i>écus d'or au soleil</i>, also called <i>écus au porc-epi</i>) took the
place of older crowns. Under Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> they were generally
23 carats fine and 71 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">6</span> to the mark, under Charles <span class="smcap">IX.</span>
23 carats fine and 72 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> to the mark. At this latter they
remained till the days of Louis <span class="smcap">XIV.</span> The change of
equivalence must be followed in the accompanying tables.</p>

<p>From the old <i>écus à la couronne</i> must be distinguished
the <i>écus heaumes</i>, which were issued in small quantities
under Charles <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, generally 48 to the mark and 22 carats
fine.</p>

<p><i>Henris d'or</i> occur only under Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span>, 23 carats fine,
2 deniers 20 grs. weight, and issued at an equivalence of
50 sols.</p>

<p><i>Louis d'or</i> (see text, p. <a href="#Page_91">91</a>), first issued in 1640 under
Louis <span class="smcap">XIII.</span> in imitation of the Spanish standard; 22 carats
fine, 36 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> to the mark, and = 10 livres. Standard and
weight remained unchanged until 1709. See tables below
for subsequent change.</p>

<p><i>Lis d'or</i> have merely a transitory importance. They
were issued in 1656 and shortly after, but almost immediately
discontinued; 23 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> carats fine, 3 deniers 3 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>
grs. the piece (60 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> to the mark) = 7 livres (to be distinguished
as a third type from the <i>fleurs de lys d'or</i> of
King John, and the separate <i>fleur de lys d'or</i> of Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span>).</p>


<h5>Silver Coins.</h5>

<p>The silver deniers of the first royal race of France
averaged 21 grs. in weight. Under the second race a
much heavier system was adopted, those of Charlemagne
weighing 28 grs., and those of Charles the Bold 32<!-- Page 403 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
grs. At the commencement of the third race they were
still of fine silver, and weighed about 23 or 24 grs.
The process of diminution by alloy and in weight began
under Philippe <span class="smcap">I.</span> For the question of the existence of a
silver solidus, see Le Blanc, Introduction, p. <a href="#Page_xii">xii</a>. If they
ever existed their place as a large silver specie was at an
early date taken by that of the <i>gros Tournois</i> (called also
<i>gros deniers d'argent</i>, <i>gros deniers blancs</i>, and <i>sols d'argent</i>),
attributed to S. Louis; 11 deniers 12 grs. fine, 7 grs.
weight (58 to the mark), and issued at an equivalence of
12 deniers or 1 sol.</p>

<p>In the commencement, therefore, of this piece the gros
Tournois was synonymous with the sol. Tournois. With
the degeneration of the standard, however, the coin (the gros)
parted company from the sol., which remained as a system
of reckoning.</p>

<p>Up to the time of Philippe de Valois this money continued
of undiminished weight and standard, and of the
greatest celebrity. When that prince, in 1343, returned to
good money after a period of debasement, he coined the
gros Tournois 60 to a mark, of fine silver, and at an
equivalence of 15 deniers Tournois. For its subsequent
course, see tables <i>infra</i>. It is noticeable that while in
weight and value the gros Tournois was frequently changed,
in fineness no diminution was made.</p>

<p><i>Parisis d'argent</i>, issued only by Philippe de Valois (of
fine silver, 4 deniers in weight = 15 deniers Tournois or
1 sol. Parisis).</p>

<p><i>Testoons</i> are to be regarded as the successors of the
gros Tournois. They were first issued by Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span><!-- Page 404 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
in 1513; 11 deniers 18 grs. fine, 7 deniers 12 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> grs.
weight, and = 10 sols. This species continued until its
interdiction by Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> in 1575, who replaced them in
that year by.</p>

<p><i>Francs d'argent</i>, 10 deniers 10 <span class="above">10</span>&#8260;<span class="below">23</span> grs. fine, 11 deniers
1 grain weight (or 17 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> to the mark), and = 20 sols.
This piece continued until the days of Louis <span class="smcap">XIII.</span></p>

<p><i>Quart d'écus</i>, also issued by Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span>, 11 deniers fine,
7 deniers 12 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> grs. weight, and = 15 sols<span class="correction" title="period added">.</span> (<i>i.e.</i> a quarter
the value of the écu d'or, then set at 60 sols.). This piece
endured till 1646.</p>

<p><i>Louis d'argent</i>, issued by Louis <span class="smcap">XIII.</span> (see p. <a href="#Page_402">402</a>, <i>Louis
d'or</i>), 11 deniers fine, 21 deniers 8 grs. weight for the écus
blancs. This money continued till the Revolution.</p>

<p><i>Lis d'argent</i>, issued for a few months in 1656, 11 deniers
12 grs. fine, 6 deniers 5 grs. weight, and = 20 sols.</p>

<p><i>Franc</i>, modern (see text, p. <a href="#Page_176">176</a>).</p>

<p>The history of the French monetary system has been
briefly told in the text, pp. <a href="#Page_10">10</a>, <a href="#Page_31">31</a>-<a href="#Page_40">40</a>, <a href="#Page_83">83</a>-<a href="#Page_95">95</a>, <a href="#Page_167">167</a>-<a href="#Page_197">197</a>.
The tables of the present Appendix afford particular
information as to the course of the above-mentioned coins,
down to the last great change in the French system.
They bring out also, in strong relief, the numerous and
arbitrary and excessive debasements which that system
underwent in the Middle Ages. The particular episode
of the eighteenth-century depreciation, which followed
upon the erection of the system of John Law, may be, in
brief, more appropriately sketched here than in the text.</p>

<p>The third of the three great recoinages of 1689, 1693,
and 1703 had left the louis d'or tariffed at an equivalence<!-- Page 405 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
of 15 livres, and the louis d'argent at 4 livres. By the
end of 1708 these figures had sunk to 12 livres 15 sols. and
3 livres 8 sols. respectively. By the decree of April 1709
quite a different standard was adopted. The louis d'or was
minted 32 to the mark, 22 carats fine, and = 16 livres
10 sols., while the louis d'argent was minted 8 to the mark,
11 deniers fine, and = 4 livres 8 sols. In the month of
May 1709 a second edict raised these equivalences to
20 livres and 5 livres respectively. The sufferings of
French commerce under this extraordinary tariff led to its
annulling by the decree of 30th September 1713, by which
a reduction of equivalence was made to 14 livres and 3
livres 10 sols. respectively. In December of the same
year a reformation was again attempted. The new species
were of the same content and fineness as the old, but were
tariffed at 20 livres for the louis d'or, and 5 livres for the
louis d'argent, while the unreformed specie were tariffed at
16 livres and 4 livres respectively. Three years later
began the period of the monetary disorder of the minority
of Louis <span class="smcap">XV.</span> In November 1716 a new louis d'or was
issued, 20 to the mark, 22 carats fine. In May 1718
again a new issue took place&mdash;louis d'or 25 to the mark,
22 carats; louis d'argent 10 to the mark, 11 deniers
fine.</p>

<p>There were thus, at the time, four different louis d'or in
existence, namely:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the 25th July 1719 the Compagnie des Indes
obtained the profit and farm of the French Mint for a term
of nine years. The first outcome of their activity was the
issue of the following tariff:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>In the same year (1719, the first of their lease) this
corporation further issued quite new species, namely,
Quinzains d'or = 15 livres, and livres d'argent =  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">6</span>-écu (both
being cut at a tale of 65 <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">11</span> to the mark). On the 5th
March 1720 all the species were raised 41 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">11</span> per cent.,
the louis d'or of 1709 thus rising to an equivalence of 40
livres, and the louis d'argent of the same issue to 10 livres.
On the 11th March 1720 the use of the gold specie was
forbidden, and a recoinage determined on. These regulations,
however, were not carried out, and by July the louis
d'or had risen to 60 livres (= 1963 <span class="above">7</span>&#8260;<span class="below">17</span> livres to the mark of
fine gold), and the louis d'argent to 15 livres (= 130 <span class="above">10</span>&#8260;<span class="below">11</span>
livres to the mark of fine silver). The same enhancement
prevailed in the divisional coin, and the confusion endured
till the end of 1720. In September the louis d'or had
fallen to 45 livres (= 1472 <span class="above">8</span>&#8260;<span class="below">11</span> livres to the mark of fine
gold), and the louis d'argent to 11 livres 5 sols. (= 98 <span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">11</span><!-- Page 407 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
livres to the mark of fine silver). At the same time (September)
a new fabrication of species, according to the
standard of 1718, was undertaken. Louis d'or, 25 to the
mark, to issue at 54 livres; louis d'argent (or  <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span>-écu), 30 to
the mark, to issue at 3 livres. But from the 24th October
a gradual diminution in this tariff was prescribed, and from
the 1st of January 1721 these coins were to circulate
respectively at 45 livres and 2 livres 10 sols. From the
same date the louis d'or of 1709 was to circulate for 22
livres 10 sols., and the louis d'argent of 1709 for 5 livres
12 sols. 6 deniers.</p>

<p>On the 5th January 1721 the contract for coinage held
by the Compagnie des Indes was annulled, and an intermediate
attempt at reform was made in 1723, when the
louis d'or was minted at 37 <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> to the mark = 27 livres, and
the louis d'argent at 10 <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> to the mark = 6 livres 18 sols.
The downward course of the specie set strongly in, and by
<span class="correction" title="corrected from '1626'">1726</span> they had fallen to 12 livres and 3 livres respectively.
This facilitated the great reform and recoinage of 1726
(see text, p. <a href="#Page_169">169</a>). This recoinage was carried out on the
basis of the edict of 1709&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Louis d'or, 30 to the mark = 20 livres.
Louis d'argent, 8 to the mark = 5 livres.
</p></blockquote>

<p>By the edict of May of the same year their equivalence
was raised 20 per cent.&mdash;the louis d'or to 24 livres, the
louis d'argent to 6 livres.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
